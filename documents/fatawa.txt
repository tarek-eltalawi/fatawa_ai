    "Question": "I would like the ruling for a plot of land which has been readied for construction and left with the purpose of its price increasing in the future. Do I need to pay zakat every year by estimating its worth?",
    "Answer": "Zakat is not due upon the mentioned plot of land as long as it has been readied for construction and has not generated any profit, except after selling and saving the proceeds and a duration of one year then passing. The amount due is one quarter of a tenth (i.e. 2.5%) of its worth. Thus, zakat is not owed on the proceeds if they are spent before the end of that year.Allah Knows the best"

    "Question": "The petitioner would like the ruling for zakat on money saved for purchasing the marital house and for marriage expenses. The sum has reached nisab (the minimum amount upon which zakat is due) and one lunar year has passed over its possession. If zakat is obligatory, how is it to be calculated for the previous years?",
    "Answer": "Prerequisites of zakat • Zakat becomes obligatory when a person's wealth reaches nisab andhas been in his possession for one full lunar year.• Zakat is obligatory upon an indebted person's wealth if the remaining sum, after deducting his debt, reaches nisab.• The nisab must be in surplus of one's basic needs because money needed to fulfill a basic need is treated as though it were non-existent.Definition of a basic needIn his meta-commentary (6/2), Ibn 'Abdin quoted the Hanafi scholar Ibn Malak's accurate scholarly definition of a basic need: \"Anything that wards off certain harm such as food and drink, housing, weapons of war and clothing to protect from heat and cold. [Basic needs also include] unforeseen expenses such as a debt which needs to be paid from the nisab to avert imprisonment (which is tantamount to harm), craft tools, household furniture, riding animals and books for the seekers of knowledge who equate ignorance with harm. The sum of money needed for any of the above needs is considered as though it were nonexistent. This is congruous to using water to quench one's thirst instead of using it for ablution; the water is considered nonexistent and, in this case, it is permissible to perform tayammum.\"[1]Ibn Malak further elaborated that no zakat is due upon the sum of money reserved for a basic need which has been in a person's possession for one lunar year. Ibn Nujaim objected to this opinion in his book Al-Bahr Al-Ra`iq (1/222) and said, \"The opinions expressed in Al-Mi'raj and Al-Bada`i' maintaining that zakat is due on money whether it is kept for savings or expenses, are antithetical to Ibn Malak's.\"After quoting the previous scholarly opinions, Ibn 'Abdin said, \"Since Ibn Malak's words are consistent with the apparent meaning of other [Hanafi] texts, it is fundamental to reconcile the opinions by interpreting what was mentioned in Al-Bada`i' and other books to mean that if a person possesses a sum of money which he needs to meet his needs and one lunar year passes over its possession, he is to pay zakat only on the remaining sum (if it reaches nisab) even if he intends to spend it in the future.This is because he does not need to spend the remaining sum on his basic needs at the time when zakat becomes due, in contrast to when he needs the remaining sum to cover his basic needs.\"The rulingBased on the above, no zakat is due on the money saved for purchasing the marital house and for covering marriage expenses because it falls under expenses for one's basic needs.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "We live in a residential building comprising 131 apartments. Each apartment owner has contributed 1000 EGP towards the property's reserve fund which is invested in an interest-bearing account. Owners pay monthly premiums of 30 EGP to cover regular building expenses. The deposited sum, 125, 000 EGP, has remained constant over the years without any decrease. Is zakat due on this fund?",
    "Answer": "Scholars have generally agreed that among the conditions obligating zakat is full ownership of property i.e. exclusive right to dispose of the property and exclusive right to interest. Scholars stated that zakat is not due upon money designated for a public benefit such as money endowed to benefit the poor, mosques, military campaigns or orphans since this money has no specific owner. Based on this principle, any property without a specific owner is considered public property that is not zakatable. Examples include properties administered and invested by the government on behalf of the community as these belong to the Public Treasury.The rulingBased on the above, zakat is not due on the mentioned reserve fund since it is not exclusively owned by a single person but is a public entity—its owners may change though the fund itself is retained.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "A CEO of a company that owns an orchard for commercial purposes wants to know which of the following crops and fruits are subject to zakat and how it is to be paid out. - 400 feddans of fruit bearing olive trees irrigated with well water through a network of drip irrigation. - 100 feddans of fruit bearing grape vines irrigated with well water through a network of drip irrigation. - 2000 fruit bearing palm trees irrigated with well water through a network of drip irrigation. - 25 feddans of fruit bearing mango trees irrigated with well water through a network of drip irrigation. - 600 feddans of grain (eg. wheat, sesame, corn, and broad beans) irrigated with canal water by means of a pump station and devices for drip irrigation. - 300 feddans of vegetables (eg. zucchini, peas, and okra) irrigated with canal water by means of a pump station through a network of drip irrigation.",
    "Answer": "There is a consensus that zakat is payable on grapes, dates, and wheat. Abdullah ibn 'Umar was asked about [zakat on] ore, pearls, gemstones, gemstone beads, and on crops such as legumes and cucumbers. He replied: \"There is no zakat on precious stones or legumes.\" The Messenger of Allah [P.B.U.H] prescribed zakat on wheat, barley, dates, and raisins\" This hadith was reported by al-Darqatni with weak chains of transmission. Ibn Hajar mentioned in Al-Talkhis that al-Bayhaqi reported a hadith through raised chain transmissions with the same meaning. He quoted al-Bayhaqi as saying that because these raised chain hadiths were related through different means, they support one another. 'Umar ibn Al-Khattab said: \"The Messenger of Allah prescribed zakat on the following four: wheat, barley, raisins, and dates\" [Al-Daraqtni]. Mu'adh and Abu Musa, may Allah be pleased with them both, said that the Messenger of Allah [P.B.U.H] sent them to Yemen to instruct the people in their religion and ordered them not to take zakat except from wheat, barley, dates, and raisins\" [Reported by al-Hakim who also declared it authentic. Al-Dhahabi maintains the same opinion]. Scholars differ on whether zakat is payable on fruits, vegetables or other kinds of crops other than wheat, barley, dates and raisins. Our opinion is to follow the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence maintaining the zakatability of fruits, vegetables and other kinds of crops as well as the staple crops that people cultivate and the sole consumption of which can sustain the body such as corn and broad beans from among those mentioned in the question. Moreover, zakat is not payable on olives because it cannot be stored, on mangoes because it is not payable on fruits other than grapes and dates, on vegetables of any kind, nor on sesame. Imam al-Damiri wrote in al-Negm al-Wahag 'ala Sharh al-Manaheg: \"There is no contention about zakat not being payable on [crops] which are not storable nor considered staple foods such as quince, apples, pomegranates, water-melons, cucumber, white beet, sesame …\" (3:1666). The Ruling Because these crops are irrigated by machines, then the payable amount of zakat is 5% due to the hadith narrated by 'Abdallah Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both): \"5% is owed on crops irrigated by artificial means\" [Bukhari]. Muslim relates a similar hadith from a narration by Jaber Ibn Abdallah (may Allah be pleased with them both). Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the extent of dealing in the stock exchange market? And what is the manner of paying zakat on shares?",
    "Answer": "1-The stock exchange is but a market for trading securities and commercial transactions. It is permissible in Islamic law to deal in the stock market by buying and selling shares in stocks of companies which engage in lawful activities with a view to participating in trade or industry. However, it is unlawful if the purpose is speculation to manipulate share prices and trick others into buying and selling unwisely. This is because it involves gambling and disturbing the [stock] prices of financial and trade corporations.2-Zakat on shares are paid:- When one lunar year passes over their possession.- If their market price reaches nisab [minimum amount upon which zakat is due] at the beginning of the lunar year and reaches or exceeds the nisab at the end of the year.This applies only for companies that engage in trade activities. Shares of companies that engage in industrial activities, services, or production are non zakatable."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6406/giving-out-zakat-ul-fitr-in-money-format",
    "Question": "Is it permissible to give out zakat ul-Fitr in money format?",
    "Answer": "It is permissible to give out one’s zakat ul-fitr in money format, as this is the position of a group of jurists who can be followed in their legal reasoning. It is also one of the opinions of the followers of the companions amongst whom were:-Al-Hasan al-Basri; he said, “There is nothing wrong in giving out dirhams for your fitr charity.” -Ishaq al-Sabi; he is narrated by Zuhayr as saying, “I saw people giving out their fitr charity in dirhams worth their foods.” - Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz; he said that the fitr charity is “half a sa’ for every person or its worth in dirhams.” This is also the opinion of al-Thawri, Abu Hanifa, and Abu Yusuf.Giving out one’s fitr charity in money is the opinion of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence and is the opinion used by them in issuing fatwas regarding all zakat issues. This is also the opinion of al-Nasir and al-Muayid Billah from the Zaydi School. This opinion has also been given by Ishaq Ibn Rahiwih and Abu Thawr except that they said it should only be applied in circumstances of necessity.This is also the opinion of a group of jurists from the Maliki School such as Ibn Habib, Asbagh, Ibn Abi Hazim, Ibn Dinar, and Ibn Wahb which they applied to both the zakat of fitr and the general zakat on money. However, what has been narrated from Ibn Qasim and Ashhab is that this is permissible in charity except in the charity of zakat and expiation of oaths.Based on this, it is clear that a good portion of jurists are of the view that it is permissible to pay one’s fitr zakat in money format and this was during their medieval context where bartering was common and possible with foodstuffs. In our time, however, what is used to barter is money and therefore the opinion that allows zakat ul-fitr to be paid in money is more appropriate. We could go as far as to say that if the jurists opposing this view lived during our time they would have permitted it.It is also clear that paying zakat in money format is better for the poor in that they can buy whatever they need on that particular day. It is possible that they are in need of clothes and not a certain foodstuff for example.The basis upon which zakat ul-fitr is religiously sanctioned is to benefit the poor during that day which all Muslims are to enjoy. The notable scholar Ahmad ibn Siddiq al-Ghumari has written treaties on this issue Tahqiq al-Amal fi Ikhraj Zakat al-Fitr bi al-Mal in which he gave preference to the Hanafi opinion using many text proofs , reaching thirty-two. Therefore, we give preference to the Hanafi opinion maintaining the permissibility of giving out zakat ul-fitr in money format as it is most appropriate to our time.And God Almighty knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6407/is-it-obligatory-to-pay-zakat-on-money-if-this-money-is-necessary-for-something-e",
    "Question": "Is it incumbent on one to pay zakat on money he owns even if this money is to be used to purchase something necessary?",
    "Answer": "There are several conditions required for money to be zakatable: the money must be one’s own completely, he must have complete control of it, it must be open to growth, more than what one needs, and the necessary period of time has elapsed for it to be zakatable , it has reached the zakatable amount which is 85 grams worth of gold, and that the person be free of anything to prevent him from paying such as debt and the like. Of these conditions, that which concerns us here is that the money be open to growth and that the money be in excess of one’s needs. These two conditions have been illustrated well by the jurists of the Hanafi school of have stated that:The condition that the money be open to growth is because the meaning of zakat, which means growth, cannot be reached except from money that is open to growth. We do not mean actual growth as this is not possible, rather we mean that the money is open to growth through investment and trade. If you would like you could say that one of the conditions is that the money be in excess to one’s needs since through this one realizes the meaning of excess wealth and pleasure which is to live in luxury and by using this excess one fulfils the goal of purifying ones self.Money that one needs for basic needs, one cannot be in need without it, nor could they have attained material pleasure since indulging in material pleasure cannot be done with one’s basic needs as these are necessary for life to continue and for one’s physical upkeep and this person’s form of thanksgiving is to be thankful for the blessing of their physical upkeep. By using this money one does not fulfill the command of purifying one’s soul which the Prophet said, “Pay the zakat on your money to purify your souls.” Therefore it would not be zakat as the reality of one being in need is an internal affair that one cannot pinpoint. Therefore one will not be able to tell the excess from the necessary, and one is need of proof to indicate this Therefore, excess money is one that is ready for growth and trade, and this is the position of the majority of scholars. Based on this, zakat is not required except on money that is extra from ones basic needs and which is open to growth and investment. The possibility of investment is itself a sign that it is beyond one’s basic needs. As for the money that a Muslim needs to purchase something necessary, there is no zakat on it. Allah is most high and all knowledgeable."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to forgive the debt of a poor person with the intention of it being zaka?",
    "Answer": "Al-Shafi’i said it was permissible in one of his positions, as did Ashhab from the Maliki school, and Ibn Hazm from the Zahiri school, and it is related as the position of al-Hasan al-Basri and ‘Ata. This is because if he were to give him zakat and then take it back from him to cover the debt it would be permissible, so this is permissible as well.If the creditor pays his zakat to his debtor, and if the debtor then returns it to his creditor, or if the debtor were to borrow enough to pay his debt and paid it to his creditor who then returned it to him and considered it zakat, it would be considered permissible according to the majority of scholars and a position in the Maliki school as long as it was not a trick to excape paying zakat by agreement or with the intention of reviving his money. If, however, it is done as a trick to escape paying zakat, then it is not permitted according to the Malikis and the Hanbalis, but it is permissible according to the Shafi’is, as long as it is not done on a condition and agreement.Ibn Hazm al-Zahiri said, “If someone who is owed money in the form of wheat, barley, gold, silver, or cattle, by one deserving of charity (ahl al-sadaqat) gives him charity in the form of the debt before it, and intends that it is from his zakat, then it is counted as such. Similarly if he were to give the debt to one who deserved it and transferred it to the person who owes him money and intended it to be zakat it would count as such. The evidence for this is that he is commanded to give the mandatory charity (al-sadaqah al-wajibah), and to give charity from his mandatory zakat to those who are deserving (ahl al-sadaqat) in accordance with what he owes. So if forgiving a debt would be considered charity (sadaqah) then it counts [as zakat]. According to Abi Sa’id al-Khudri there was a man during the time of the Prophet who was afflicted in fruits (thimar) that he had purchased so that his debts were great. The Messenger of God said, ‘Give him charity.’ And this is the position of ‘Ata ibn Abi Rabah and others.”Based on this we see nothing to prevent counting the forgiving of a debt as zakat, although it is better to give the debtor enough time to pay back the debt or to forsake the debt for God and not to consider it as Zakat in order to extricate oneself from the difference of opinion, or to forgive the debt out of a sense of charity other than zakat, or to give him the money and then take it from him, even if it is the same money, in order to prevent the trick that some people commit especially when it comes to transactions between businessmen. And God is Most High and Knows Best."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to give zakat on wealth to the Cancer Institute?Is it permissible to donate a sum of money to the Cancer Institute as an ongoing charity?",
    "Answer": "Muslim scholars have established that there is a right in one's wealth other than zakat. This includes voluntary charity, ongoing charity, and endowments as attested to by the words of Allah the Almighty Who says, And in their wealth there is a due share for the beggar and the deprived. [Al-Zariyat: 19]This is in addition to the obligatory zakat mentioned in the following verse, And in whose wealth is a recognized right for the needy who asks and him who is deprived (for some reason from asking). [Al-Ma'arij: 24-25]All of this is out of benevolence without which a Muslim's worship is incomplete. Allah the Almighty says, O ye who believe! Bow down, prostrate yourselves, and adore your Lord; And do good; that ye may prosper. [Al-Hajj: 77]The Prophet said, \"Charity extinguishes sins as water extinguishes fire.\"The recipients of zakat, which is obligatory and one of the pillars of Islam, have been defined in the following Qur`anic verse,Alms are for the poor and the needy, and for those employed to administer the (funds): For those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth); for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: (Thus is it) ordained by Allah. And Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. [At-Tauba: 60[Dar al-Ifta advices the public to hasten to make donations to charitable cancer institutesand hospitals such as the Cancer Institute and to establish three funds:1-Endowment fund: People endow their money towards this fund and the generated proceeds are permanently directed to the Cancer Institute to treat its patients.2-Charity fund: This fund is directed to financing, constructing, furnishing and maintaining the institute as well as presenting it in a manner that befits Muslims, both constructionally and aesthetically .3-Zakat fund: This fund is to finance the purchase and maintenance of equipment, as well as finance medicine, treatment expenses and hospital stays, and food and drink. It covers the expenses that are linked to the patients either directly or indirectly such the salaries of hospital personnel and doctors, the cost of surgical operations, diagnostic imaging and the like.Dar al-Ifta calls upon Muslims both inside and outside Egypt to participate in such charitable institutes and hospitals which alleviate the great pain of the afflicted as attested to by the words of the Messenger of Allah who said, \"The Most Merciful bestows His mercy on those who show mercy [to others]; have mercy on those on earth and you will be shown mercy by He Who is in the Heavens.\"The rulingIt is permissible to give zakat on wealth to the Cancer Institute according to the above illustrated manner. Donating money to the Cancer Institute as an ongoing charity The principle is that an ongoing charity is any charity whose benefit or reward is permanent as defined by the Maliki scholar al-Qadi 'Ayyad in his book Mashareq Al-Anwar 'ala Sihah Al-Athar. Some scholars interpreted his definition to denote endowments. This is because ongoing charity is best actualized in endowments since the endowed property is retained and its benefit is renewed. The aspect of perpetuity is true of the equipments used to treat patients as is the case of everything that remains and whose benefit is enduring. This is categorized under ongoing charity.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the permissibility of paying part of zakat in the form of foodstuffs needed by any household such as rice, sugar oil and the like?",
    "Answer": "The principle is that zakat be paid from the same type of goods on which it is due. When the Prophet [pbuh] sent Mu'adh to Yemen, he told him, \"Take grains from grains, sheep from sheep, camels from camels, and cows from cows\" [Reported by Abu Dawud, ibn Majah and al Hakim who declared it authentic]. Hanafi scholars and others maintained the permissibility of paying an equivalent value from wealth other than the same kinds of goods upon which it is due. This is because the original restriction was meant only to facilitate its payment (from goods he already possessed) and not because it is in itself obligatory. They based their opinion on Tawus' report in which he said, \"Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him) told the people of Yemen, 'Bring me fabric and garments as zakat instead of barley and corn; this is easier for you and better for the Companions of the Prophet in Medina\" [Reported by Bukhari and Bayhaqi]. Imam Al-Shafi'i said that even though Tawus did not meet Mu`adh, he knew that Mu'adh understood the Prophet's order in light of the general benefit inasmuch as this facilitated matters for the zakat givers. He therefore refrained from accepting zakat from the same kind of goods possessed by the zakat giver when he realized that the benefit of the people lay elsewhere. This was because the people of Yemen were famous for their textile industry and thus it was easier for them to pay their zakat from the merchandise they produced and because these fabrics were needed by the people of Medina.Umar ibn al-Khatab (may Allah be pleased with him) used to do the same. Sa'id ibn Mansur reported in his Sunan that `Atta said, \"Umar ibn al-Khattab used to take trade goods as zakat instead of dirhams [money].\"This is the opinion we prefer, since the ultimate objective of zakat is to fulfill the needs of the poor and the needy. As long as the kinds of goods paid as zakat fulfill the needs of the poor and are beneficial to them, they fulfill the objective of zakat.The Ruling It is permissible to pay part of one's zakat in the form of foodstuff that suit the needs of the poor and the destitute.Allah Almighty knows best."

Since, the obligatoriness of the above kinds of foodstuff refers to their material value and not necessarily to their specific kinds, it is therefore permissible to pay the equivalent value of any of the above in cash, trade goods or in any other form.Imam Sarkhasy wrote in Al-Mabsut (vol. 3, pp. 107-8), \"It is permissible in our school to pay the equivalent value of wheat, since the objective of zakat is to fulfill the needs of the people and this is met by either paying it in cash or in the form of wheat grain.\" Imam Al-Shafi'i (may God have mercy upon him) contends otherwise and the reason for these differences of opinion is because zakat had been originally been prescribed to be paid in kind.Abu Bakr Al-A'mash (may God grant him mercy) said, \"It is better to pay zakat in the form of wheat grain instead of paying its cash equivalent because this is closer to the original command [for zakat] and further from scholarly contention. It is therefore more religiously cautious.\" The jurist Abu Ja'far (may God have mercy on him) who has an opposing opinion, said, \"It is better to pay the cash equivalent of zakat because this is closer to benefitting the poor since it will allow them to purchase their immediate needs. The reason for specifying wheat and barley at the time of the Prophet was because they were used as a medium of exchange in al-Medina. But here where currency is the medium of exchange, it is preferable to pay the cash equivalent of zakat.\" This is likewise the opinion of a group from among the successors and scholars reckoned to be among them, including:- Al-Hasan al-Basri. He was reported to have said, \"There is no objection to paying zakat ul-fitr in dirhams.\"- Abu Ishaq al-Suba'i: Zuhair reported that he heard Abu Ishaq say, \"I was present at the time of the Companions and they paid the cash value of zakat ul-fitr.\"- 'Umar Ibn 'Abdul-'Aziz: Waqi' narrated through Qura who said, \"We received a letter from 'Umar Ibn 'Abdul-'Aziz concerning zakat ul-fitr. It said, 'Half a sa` for each person or its equivalent of half a dirham.' \"These non-prophetic traditions were reported by Imam Abu Bakr Ibn Abu Shayba in Al-Mussanaf (vol. 2, p. 398). Al-Thawri and Ishaq Ibn Rahwiya likewise maintained the same opinion, citing the permissibility of giving zakat ul-fitr in cash though they restricted this permissibility to cases of necessity as mentioned by Imam An-Nawawi in Majmou' Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab (vol. 6, p. 112).The Hanbali scholar, Sheikh Taqiy ad-Din Ibn Taimiya, likewise maintained its permissibility in cases of need and overriding public welfare. He wrote in Majmu' Al-Fatawa (vol. 25, pp. 25-83): \"The apparent opinion is that it is not permissible to pay the equivalent value of zakat without there being a need or interest therein. Otherwise, there is no harm.\"The opinion maintaining that the obligation of zakat-ul-fitr is fulfilled by giving out the equivalent value in cash was mentioned in a report from Imam Ahmed which Al-Mawardi cited in Al-Insaf (vol. 3, p. 182).The rulingThe opinion we choose for fatwa which, in our view meets the objectives of Islamic law and is compatible with the interests of the people, is the permissibility of paying zakat ul-fitr in cash. This is the opinion of Hanafi scholars and the opinion implemented in their school concerning zakat in general, kaffarat, vows, land tax and so forth. As previously mentioned, it is likewise the opinion of a group from among the Successors.God the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "I am an unmarried working female and have a separate source of income from my father.o Do I have to pay zakat or does the zakat my father pays in his capacity as my guardian suffice? Please take into account that I give voluntary charity from my own money. If zakat is due on my income, kindly inform me when it is to be paid, how it is calculated, and what are the preferable channels of its distribution? o Do I have to pay zakat on my jewelry which I only use for ornamentation?",
    "Answer": "The inquirer is financially independent of her father. Since she has her own separate income, zakat is obligatory in the presence of the following conditions:• The money reaches nisab [minimum amount upon which zakat is due] which is the equivalent of 85 grams of 21 carat gold.• A lunar year passes upon its possession.• The inquirer is debt free.If the above conditions are met, the inquirer is to pay zakat on her property with the intention of zakat and not sadaqah.According to the opinion of some scholars, there is no zakat on jewelry if it is for personal use."

    "Question": "The inquirer deposited 500,000 EGP in Faisal Bank with the intention of fulfilling some vows which he had pledged to make if Allah delivers him from his troubles. These include:1. Slaughtering an animal worth 5000 EGP and distributing its meat among the poor and the destitute;2. Giving out 600 EGP;3. He built two charity graves for 20,000 EGP, one for men and the other for women from among poor Muslims;4. He pledged to pay 30, 000 EGP towards a 'umra for himself and his three daughters;5. He contributed 8, 000 EGP towards building a mosque;6. He donated 7, 000 EGP to cancer patients; 2, 000 EGP to an orphanage; and 3, 000 EGP to the poor and the destitute.The inquirer requests a clarification of the ruling on the following:• Whether the above mentioned sums are counted from his zakat on wealth;• Whether they are counted from his zakat for more than one lunar year;• The amount of zakat on the sum deposited in the bank which is 500,000 EGP.",
    "Answer": "A vow is what a person willingly obligates upon himself such as performing acts of worship or sadaqat (either as a voluntary or communally obligatory act). The legal premises for this are the words of Allah the Almighty in praise of those who fulfill their vows, They perform (their) vows, and they fear a Day whose evil flies far and wide.[Al-Insan: 7]The Prophet also said, \"Whoever makes a vow that entails obeying Allah, then let him obey Him (i.e. fulfill his vow); and whoever makes a vow that entails disobeying Him, let him not disobey Him (i.e. should not fulfill his vow)\" [Bukhari, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Nisa`i and Ibn Majah].Kinds of vowsVows are of two kinds: Vows made to draw close to Allah and vows made out of anger and disputation. It is clear from the question that the inquirer's vow is of the first kind and that he made his vow conditional upon gaining good and warding off evil, which is the settlement of his debts. This kind of vow is valid and therefore must be fulfilled due to the words of Allah the Almighty Who says, Amongst them are men who made a covenant with Allah, that if He bestowed on them of His bounty; they would give (largely) in charity, and be truly amongst those who are righteous.But when He did bestow of His bounty, they became covetous, and turned back (from their covenant), averse (from its fulfillment). So He hath put as a consequence hypocrisy into their hearts, (to last) till the Day, whereon they shall meet Him: because they broke their covenant with Allah, and because they lied (again and again).[At-Tauba: 75-77] These verses express Allah's censure and punishment to those who do not fulfill their vows.Vows vs. zakatAnything spent in fulfillment of a vow is not counted from one's zakat on wealth. This is because a vow is what a person willingly imposes upon himself, choosing its amount and manner of execution. This contrasts with zakat which is an obligation ordained by Allah upon His servants and whose amount and kind are determined by Him.The ruling- The inquirer's vow to slaughter an animal worth 5000 EGP,distribute 600 EGP among the poor, and pay 30,000 EGP towards a 'umra for himself and his three daughters are not to be counted from his zakat on wealth.- The cost of building the two graves and the sum contributed towards building a mosque, are not calculated from his zakat; rather, they are considered either a sadaqah [voluntary alms] or a charitable and voluntary act.- If at the time the inquirer paid the money to the cancer patients, the orphanage and the poor and the destitute, his intention was that they be from his zakat, then they are considered as such and counted from his zakat on wealth for the coming years. This is because, there is no objection to paying zakat two years in advance. - The zakat on the money deposited in the bank is 2.5% of the sum present in the bank account at the end each lunar year when it reaches nisab [minimum sum upon which zakat is due].Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "The Zakat Fund at our local mosque receives Zakat ul-Fitr and distributes it among deserving recipients. Its distribution ended by midnight of the eve of 'Eid ul-Fitr but people continued to deposit their zakat and by 'Eid prayers, we had 6000 LE in zakat funds. What should we do with this sum? Should we buy a sacrificial animal and distribute its meat among the poor or should we distribute the money among them?",
    "Answer": "The majority from among the Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali scholars maintain, as does al-Hasan ibn Ziad, the Hanafi scholar, that the obligatory time for paying Zakat ul-Fitr is restricted. Therefore, whoever gives it out after sunset of the day of 'Eid without an excuse is blameworthy and must make it up (by paying it late). The majority of Hanafi scholars maintain that the obligatory time for giving out Zakat-ul-Fitr is unrestricted because the command for paying it is not limited. Therefore, paying it at any time does not necessitate making it up. However, it is recommended to give it out before going to 'Eid prayer.Scholars concur that Zakat-ul-Fitr is not waived if its prescribed time elapses because it is a financial obligation upon one who is elgible; it is therefore a debt that is not waived except by its performance. Sheikh al-Bajuri, a Shafi'i scholar, wrote: \"It is permissible to pay it—i.e. Zakat-ul-Fitr at the beginning of the month of Ramadan but it is recommended to do so before 'Eid Prayer (if the 'Eid prayer was held early in the day) following the example of the Prophet [pbuh]; otherwise, it is recommended to pay it at the beginning of the day (of Eid). It is disliked to delay giving it out until the end of the day of 'Eid i.e. before sunset, and prohibited to give it out after that time. In this respect, Zakat-ul-Fitr is unlike Zakat-ul-Mal which is permissible to delay provided this does not cause hardship upon the recipients.\"Sins depend upon a person's choice, intent or ability; therefore, the majority of scholars maintain that whoever was unable or forgot to pay it on time must make it up, but according to Hanafi scholars, he is to give it out when he remembers or is able to and is not blameworthy. The RulingBased on this, the sum of money in the charity box must be paid at once in cash to its deserving recipients and you are not to buy anything for them out of this sum."

    "Question": "Our association depends on donations to fund its services and develop its projects. These donations include sadaqah [voluntary alms], gifts and zakat on wealth. To spend the money according to Islamic principles, we wish to inquire about the following:1. Is it obligatory to distinguish between sadaqah and zakat money? 2. What are the expenditures of each? 3. Is it permissible to spend the funds of zakat and sadaqah on constructing the association's mosque and its service complexes?",
    "Answer": "Based on what is mentioned in the question, we inform you that: 1.It is obligatory to distinguish between sadaqah and zakat funds because there are differences between them, including the different channels for their distribution which is the main concern of your association.2.The circle of recipients of sadaqah is wider than that of zakat. Zakat is distributed exclusively among Muslims. This is derived from the hadith narrated by Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both), \"Zakat is to be taken from the rich amongst the Muslims and returned to their poor\" [Recorded by Bukhari and Muslim]. Moreover, it is exclusively paid to the eight recipients mentioned in the Qur`an Zakah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect [zakah] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allah. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. [At-Tawbah, 60] This means that the recipients of sadaqah may include the eight channels mentioned in the above verse as well as others who may be either Muslims or non-Muslims. 3. Concerning the construction of the mosque and service complex, they must be financed from sadaqah and not from zakat funds, since zakat is primarily spent on people and not buildings, for [deserving] worshippers and not for mosques. This is because the basic principle of zakat is to fulfill the needs of the poor and those in need and to maintain their livelihood since the Prophet made specific reference to them in the hadith mentioned above. The majority of scholars stipulated that zakat must be transferred to the possession of the poor, enabling them to spend it on their needs of which they are more knowledgeable than others. This aim cannot be achieved if the funds are spent on the construction of mosques or service complexes. The rulingBased on this, the construction of mosques and service complexes must be financed from the funds of sadaqah and not from those of zakat.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6397/giving-zakat-on-wealth-in-the-form-of-food-to-break-anothers-fast-and-giving-out",
    "Question": "• What is the ruling for giving zakat on wealth in the form of food to break another's fast?• Is the expiation to be given out as raw or cooked food?",
    "Answer": "Zakat is one of the pillars of Islam. Islamic law prescribed different ways for spending in charity; it encourages [social] welfare and cooperation in doing good deeds, making donations and maintains the excellence of giving gifts. Moreover, it recommends giving sadaqah [alms] which includes sadaqah embodied in waqf [Charitable endowments] whose benefits are constant. The aim of this diversity is to encourage Muslims to spend in different forms of charity. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"There are financial dues on one's property other than zakat,\" after which he recited the words of God: \"Righteousness is not that you turn your faces towards the east or west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in God, and the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; and who establishes prayer and gives zakat; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; [and those] who are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous\" (Quran 2:177).This hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi and others and contains some weakness, however, it was authentically attributed as a statement of Ibn 'Umar (may God be pleased with them both), al- Sha'bi, Mujahid, and Tawus.Imam al-'Aini stated in 'Umdaat al-Qari (8/237): \"Sufyan ibn '‘Uyayna interpreted the Quranic verse: \"Indeed, God has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties [in exchange] for that they will have Paradise\" (Quran 9:111) as: the believers are obligated to strive to draw closer to God by spending [in charity] for His sake when they learn of a person's need. For this reason many scholars maintain that there are financial dues other than zakat on one's wealth—a hadith that was reported as a raised chain tradition by al-Tirmidhi.\"Among the pious worshippers described by God are those who offer food to others. He says: \"And they give food in spite of love for it to the needy, the orphan, and the captive\" (Quran 76:8).Giving food for the sake of God is not restricted to a specific timeThis charity may be made both during Ramadan and at other times although in Ramadan its reward is greater. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) encouraged Muslims to break the fast of others; he said: \"Whoever breaks another's fast earns the same reward as the one who fasted without diminishing the latter's reward in the slightest\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi who declared it fair and authentic).Salman al-Farsi narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Whoever breaks another's fast will have his sins forgiven and will be saved from Hell-Fire. He will earn the same reward as the fasting person without diminishing the latter's reward in the slightest.\" They [the companions] said, \"O Messenger of God! Not all of us are capable of giving food to a fasting person.\" The Prophet ([peace and blessings be upon him) replied, \"God gives this reward to whoever breaks another's fast with some milk mixed with water, a date, or a drink of water; whoever satisfies the hunger or thirst of a fasting person, God will give him to drink from my fountain on the Day of Judgment and he will never thirst until he enters Paradise\" (Reported by ibn Khuzayma in his Sahih).Mawa`id al-RahmanMawa`id al-Rahman [literally, tables of the Most Merciful i.e. public dinners held in Ramadan as charity], a common practice nowadays, does not qualify as zakat although it is an honorable act of charity and welfare between Muslims. The reason is because it caters to the rich and poor alike. God determined the channels of zakat in the Quran:\"Zakat expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect [zakat] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler—an obligation [imposed] by Allah. Allah is Knowing and Wise\" (Quran 9:60).God classifies the poor and the destitute as the most deserving of zakat by mentioning them first in the Quranic verse and because the basic principle of zakat is to fulfill their needs. It is for this reason that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) made specific reference to them when he sent Mu'adh to Yemen and told him: \"If they obey you in this [Islam], tell them that God has enjoined upon them alms to be taken from their rich and returned to their poor\" (Bukhari and Muslim).In the Quranic verse, the letter 'lam' is prefixed to the noun fuqara` meaning 'for the poor' to indicate possession. Due to this, the majority of scholars stipulate that zakat must be transferred to the possession of the poor, enabling them to spend it on their needs of which they are more knowledgeable than others. However, some scholars permit giving out zakat in the form of material goods when the giver knows of the recipient's needs, thus fulfilling his needs.Spending money on food to break a person's fast, whether poor or rich, does not qualify as zakat. It is among the other forms of charity and welfare among Muslims such as sadaqat and donations. It cannot be considered zakat except if the person who holds 'Ramadan dinners' stipulates that only the poor, the needy, and the [stranded] traveler from among the Muslims may eat from them. Only then is it permissible to give out food as zakat which is then tantamount to transferring it to their possession. This is the opinion of the Hanafis and some Zaydi scholars as reported by Abu Yusuf.Ramadan parcelsRamadan parcels (bags containing staple foodstuff) which is specifically given to the poor can be made from zakat because they fulfill the condition of ownership.ExpiationThe opinion of the majority of scholarsThe majority of scholars agree that items given in expiation must be passed into the recipient's possession. They contend that it is not sufficient to allow others to share in their wealth or use it, but hold that the obligation is one which requires the transfer of possession from one party to another. Because zakat requires a financial transfer, the recipient must take it in the prescribed amount.The HanafisThey maintain a different opinion. They find it sufficient to invite the poor to eat from food prepared specially for them. They base their opinion on the original meaning of the word 'food' in the Arabic language which denotes 'establishment' and not 'possession' and on the Quranic verse: \"...with food equivalent to what you would normally give your own families\" (Quran 5:89). Feeding one's family does not mean actually transferring the ownership of one's property to them.The RulingThere is no objection to making expiation in the form of cooked food following the opinion of the scholars who permit it. However, it is preferable to give it out as wholegrain because it is recommended to remove oneself from controversy (by taking an approach which is agreed upon to be acceptable).God Almighty knows best"

There are [different] categories of indebtors: A person who is overwhelmed by his debt which he accumulated for a lawful matter—willingly or not—(even though he may have spent it on something unlawful); a person who accumulated a debt for an unlawful reason but spent it on something lawful or on something unlawful for which he became indebted and later repented or is thought to have repented. He is given [zakat] because he is in need of it i.e. he does not have the means to settle his debt. This is in contrast to the person who accumulates a debt for something unlawful and spends it but does not repent. If he were not in need, he should not be given zakat.\"The RulingIt is permissible for this man to receive zakat from the mentioned charitable organization to settle his debt if he had not already done so, or if his creditors had not waived his debt and asked him to fulfill it."

    "Question": "Can you give a poor person a sum of money that would make them wealthy or should poor people only receive that which would satisfy their basic needs?",
    "Answer": "Muslim society seeks to eradicate poverty, illiteracy, corruption, and negative things that cause it harm. It is a society guided by God’s final religion and follows His Chosen Prophet. It is better that the zakat one gives a poor person be enough that it enriches him since this leads to the eradication of that individual’s poverty and it includes that person in the charitable endeavors of his brothers in paying zakat the following year. It is permissible to give a poor person zakat that will sustain them for an average lifespan (ghalib al-umr], meaning that which will sustain him for sixty years. There are positions that say it is permissible to give him that which will sustain him for up to one-hundred years, as is mentioned by al-Ramli, and as is the position of al-Shafi’i. Al-Nawawi said, “The adherents of our school from Iraq, as well as many of them from Khurasan said, “They are given that which will elevate them from need to wealth which enough to have enough continuously. This is the text of al-Shafi’i.” This is confirmed by what al-Nawawi chose in al-Minhaj and its commentary by Jalal al-Din al-Mahali who said, “(I said: The more correct position for which there is a text and which is the position of the majority) [is that] he gives (enough for an average lifespan so he can buy real estate from which to benefit) and be wealthy enough to not require zakat (and God Know best). And those who gain their sustenance through a craft are given that with which they can purchase the required tools, I said, ‘their value, even if it is a lot.’ Those who make their living by trade are given that with which they can purchase that which can be traded or whose profits can sustain him for an average lifespan.” The Shafi’i clarified what is meant by an average lifespan is sixty years, and that if a person were to be poor past that age they would take enough zakat to sustain them for one year, then one year after that, and so on. This was stated by al-Ramli who said, “(It was asked) concerning their saying, ‘a pauper is given enough to sustain him for an average lifespan,’ what is the definition of an average lifespan, and what is the amount that is given if that age is passed? (He answered) that the definition of an average lifespan is sixty years, and that if that is surpassed then [the pauper] is given enough to sustain him for one year, and if that year passes he is given enough for another year. The father has another answer, which is that the limit of an average lifespan is the age that the individual is reasonably expected not to surpass, which, in the correct opinion, cannot be defined with an age. It has also been said that it is defined as being seventy years, eighty years, ninety years, and one hundred years, and if he lives beyond those years he is given enough to sustain him for one year, and if he lives beyond that year he is given enough to sustain him for one year, and so on and so forth.” This is also the position adopted by Ibn Taymiyah related by al-Mardawi who said, “Sheikh Taqi al-Din said, ‘It is permitted to take one sum of money that would make him wealthy even if it is a lot.’”Based on the preceding quotes from the Shafi’i School and others, it is our opinion that it is permissible to give a pauper zakat that would make him rich and take him out of what is considered to be poverty. It is even permissible to give him enough to sustain himself for an average lifespan as was mentioned. And God is Most High and Knows Best."

Based on this, it is permissible to commission another to perform hajj on your behalf.Conditions for the permissibility of commissioning another to perform hajj on one's behalf- That the expenses of the journey be from the money of the commissioner (who is unable to perform the journey himself), from the money of the deceased (if he had asked that someone perform hajj on his behalf after his death, or from contributed money if the deceased had not asked that hajj be performed on his behalf).- That the agent make the intention of performing hajj on behalf of the person who is unable to go himself or on behalf of the deceased.- That the commissioned person had made his own obligatory hajj."

    "Question": "Is it permissible for women, the ill and the weak to commission others to stone on their behalf?",
    "Answer": "It is permissible to stone on behalf of the weak, the ill and women. The basis for this is the permissibility of performing hajj on behalf of another; therefore commissioning another to stone on one's behalf is more of a priority. This is because hajj includes stoning as well as other rites. This commission is a dispensation for those who have an excuse preventing them from performing the rite themselves. For this reason, many scholars mentioned grounds other than those mentioned in the hadiths, by way of interpreting subsidiary questions in light of primary issues. These include those who fear for themselves, their property, or a caregiver.The rulingIt is permissible for the weak, the ill and women to commission others to stone on their behalf. There is no objection to this and they are not obliged to make expiation.And God Almighty knows best."

My wife (and I agree with her) wants to give her father a sum from her own money that suffices for the expenses of hajj and 'umrah. Both my wife and I have performed our obligatory hajj. Is it legally permissible for my wife's father to perform hajj or 'umrah from his daughter's money?",
    "Answer": "There is no legal impediment if your wife pays for her father's hajj or 'umrah from her own money. This is out of dutifulness, benevolence, and maintaining ties of kinship. By giving money to the donee—no matter who he is—the money is transferred into his ownership and this fulfills the condition of capability that is necessary for hajj. God the Almighty says,Pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to God,—those who can afford the journey. [Al-'Imran, 97]"

[Al-Baqarah, 158]In this holy verse, God Almighty commands pilgrims to make sa'y between as-Safa and al-Marwa and this demonstrates that the entire area between them is a place where the rite may be performed.

    "Answer": "It is established in Islamic law that owning the expenses of hajj or 'umrah, (referred to in fiqh as having the expenses for provisions and transportation), is a condition for the obligation of hajj and not for its validity. This means that lacking these expenses at the time of hajj season does not render hajj invalid but only means that it is not an obligation for one who does not have the expenses needed to undertake it at that time. But if the expenses become available to him through a grant, gift, contribution, or through any other means as mentioned in the question, it is then permissible for him to make hajj from this money, and his hajj will be valid and fulfills the obligation.

    "Answer": "It is permissible for a Muslim who is unable to perform hajj himself to hire someone to perform it on his behalf.

This is the opinion of the majority of scholars. 'Abdullah Ibn Abbas (may God be pleased with them both) said, \"Al-Fadl Ibn Abbas was riding behind the Messenger of God when a woman from Khath'am approached the Prophet and asked, 'O Messenger of God! My father is an old man and is unable to ride to hajj; therefore, he cannot fulfill this obligation. Is it permissible for me to perform hajj on his behalf?'

    "Question": "Some people lie on the official documents that they are asked to submit and give false information for the sake of traveling for hajj. For instance, they may falsely claim that they have not previously performed hajj. Is lying in such a case permissible? And is it permissible for a driver, for instance, to falsely claim that he has previously performed hajj to be able to work as a driver during the hajj season? And is it permissible to stay behind in the Sacred land after the hajj season to work and worship God?",
    "Answer": "It is established in Islamic law that it is obligatory to defer to the rulings of those vested with authority provided their rulings are not unlawful and there is no consensus on their unlawfulness. Ibn 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet said, \"A Muslim must hear and obey those vested with authority concerning what he likes and what he does not like, unless he is commanded to do a wrong action. Otherwise, he must not obey\" [Recorded by Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Al-Nisa`i and Abu Dawud].A ruler is entitled to pass laws that, in his opinion, achieve the interests of his people. Whoever enters a country must conform to its laws and it is prohibited to violate them. It is prohibited to lie in all cases, except those deemed exceptions by Islamic law. Examples of such cases are included in the hadith narrated by Asmaa` Bint Yazid who narrated that the Prophet said, \"It is not valid to lie except in three situations: when a man talks to his wife (to please her), to settle disagreements between people, and in war\" [Recorded by Ibn Abu Shaybah, at-Tirmidhi, and others].Based on this, the types of lies mentioned in the question are from among what is unlawful and are not included among the exceptions made and deemed permissible by Islamic law.The rulingIt is impermissible to deceive authorities by giving false information, whether for the purpose of traveling to perform hajj or to achieve any other interest in one's country or in one's country of destination. It is likewise impermissible to extend one's stay after completing the rites of hajj if the ruler forbids this."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to perform sa'y before circumambulating the Ka'bah?",
    "Answer": "Hanafi and Maliki scholars have maintained the necessity of making sa'y after a valid circumambulation, even if after a supererogatory one. In Shafi'i and Hanbali jurisprudence, it is a condition to perform sa'y after the obligatory circumambulation or tawaf al-qudum. There is no harm if there is an interval between the two though tawaf al-qudum and sa'y must not be interrupted by standing at 'Arafat in between. In such a case, the sa'y does not fulfill the obligation except after tawaf al-ifada. They based their opinion on the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) performed sa'y after circumambulating the Ka'bah and it was reported that he said, \"Take the [pilgrimage] rites [from me]\" (Muslim).'Ata`, Dawud al-Dhahiri and some hadith scholars reported that it is not a condition to circumambulate the Ka'bah first. Imam Ahmed said in one report that if a pilgrim absentmindedly makes sa'y before circumambulating the Ka'bah, this meets the obligation. The legal premise for their opinion is the hadith narrated by Usama Ibn Sharik (may God be pleased with him) who said, \"I accompanied the Prophet on hajj. People would come to him and some would say, 'O Messenger of God! I made sa'y before circumambulating the Ka'bah' or 'I performed or such-and-such before or after such-and-such.' He would tell them, 'There is no harm in this, there is no harm except for a person who unjustly slanders a fellow Muslim. Such a person is sinful\" (recorded by Abu Dawud with an authentic chain of ascription).The majority of scholars interpreted the hadith which mentions 'made sa'y before circumambulating the Ka'bah' to mean making sa'y after tawaf al-qudum and before tawaf al-ifada.The rulingBased on the above, it is permissible for a pilgrim on hajj tamattu' to make sa'y before tawaf al-qudum following the apparent meaning of the aforementioned hadith and acting upon the dispensation of those scholars who permit this.And God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling for the weak, ill or women from among the pilgrims not spending the night at Mina?",
    "Answer": "There is a scholarly debate on the obligation of spending the night at Mina on the days of tashriq [the three days following 'Eid]. The majority of scholars have maintained that it is obligatory, while Hanafi scholars maintained that it is recommended. Ibn 'Umar (may God be pleased with them both) related that 'Abbas (may God be pleased with him) sought permission from the Prophet to spend the nights of Mina at Mecca since he was responsible for supplying the pilgrims with water and the Prophet granted him permission\" [Bukhari and Muslim]. Therefore, it has become known that it is a sunnah (i.e. recommended). If we add to the above, the extreme exhaustion of the pilgrims, limited places and fear of spreading diseases, then the chosen opinion for fatwa is its non obligatory.If we maintain the recommendation, and not obligation, of staying overnight at Mina, then the ruling for those who neglect to stay overnight for all of the three days of Mina according to some scholars is the recommendation (and not obligation) of offering a sacrifice in expiation. And whoever neglects to stay overnight for one night, is to expiate by giving out a mudd (510 grams) of food.Hanafi scholars, and Imam Ahmed in one report, maintained that no expiation is due upon anyone who does not spend the night at Mina. Even the majority of scholars who maintained the obligatoriness of staying overnight at Mina, granted a dispensation to anyone who has a valid excuse. Such a person is not blameworthy, does not have to make expiation, nor is his action disliked. There is no doubt that fear of contracting a disease is among the legitimate excuses for not spending the night at Mina that are taken into consideration.Imam Malik related in his Muwatta` through 'Asem Ibn 'Adiyy (may God be pleased with him) that the Prophet gave the camel shepherds permission to encamp for the night outside Mina. He allowed them to stone on yawm an-nahr, combine two days' stoning on the next day and then stone on the day of their departure.One must not take literal readings of texts into consideration without giving thought to the Legislator's purpose or else it is considered pure obstinacy.It is known that obligating pilgrims to stay overnight at Mina along with the other rites of hajj only increases their exhaustion and compromises their ability to ward off epidemics and fatal diseases which are easily spread in crowded areas and which have become a global phenomenon. There is no doubt that women, children, the ill and the weak are the most susceptible to such harm, so it is only fitting to extend the permissibility of omitting the overnight stay at Mina to them."

    "Answer": "It is established in Islamic law that owning the expenses of hajj or 'umrah (referred to in fiqh as having the expenses for provisions and transportation), is a condition for the obligation of hajj and not for its validity. This means that lacking these expenses at the time of hajj season, does not invalidate hajj; it only means that it is not an obligation if one does not have the expenses needed to undertake it, and, therefore, one is not blameworthy for not performing it at that time. However, it is required to complete the rites of hajj once one enters the state of ihram; hajj is then valid and its obligation is fulfilled. The same ruling applies to 'umrah.The rulingThere is no legal objection to paying for hajj and 'umrah in installments. Similarly, there is no objection to the difference in price between what the bank pays the company and that which the company asks the client."

They will then head to Mina to stone Jamarat al-'Aqaba al-Kubra. Is this route permissible for pilgrims on hajj tamattu' or must they depart from Muzdalifa and proceed to Mina to stone Jamarat al-'Aqaba al-Kubra before their full release from ihram?",
    "Answer": "Performing tawaf al-ifada before stoning Jamarat al-'AqabaAccording to the opinion of the majority of scholars, it is legally permissible to perform tawaf al-ifada before stoning Jamarat al-'Aqaba al-Kubra; Maliki scholars have maintained that inverting the order by performing tawaf al-ifada before stoning Jamarat al-'Aqaba al-Kubra may be rectified by slaughtering in expiation. The majority of scholars who permit this substantiated their opinion with the hadith narrated by 'Abdullah Ibn 'Amr (may God be pleased with them both) who said, \"A man approached the Prophet who was standing at the stoning site on yawm al-nahr and said, 'O Messenger of God! I shaved my head before stoning.' The Prophet replied, 'Stone and there is no harm in this.' Another man approached the Prophet and said, 'I slaughtered before stoning.' The Prophet replied, 'Stone and there is no harm in this.' A third man approached the Prophet and said, 'I performed tawaf al-ifada before stoning.' The Prophet replied, 'Stone and there is no harm in this.' Ibn 'Amr said, 'On that day, the Prophet was not asked about anything to which he did not reply, 'Do so and there is no harm in it\" [Recorded by Imam Muslim in his Sahih].Release from ihramRelease from ihram occurs in two stages:1- The first or partial release from ihram renders permissible all of the things that were unlawful during ihram except for sexual intercourse or foreplay. It is accomplished by the following: shaving the head according to Hanafi scholars, stoning according to Maliki and Hanbali scholars and doing any two of the three rites of yawm al-nahr according to Shafi'i scholars (with the exception of slaughtering because it is not among the things necessary for release from ihram).2- The second or full release from ihram renders permissible all of the things that were unlawful in ihram. It is accomplished by performing tawaf al-ifada only provided one shaves his head according to Hanafi scholars, performing tawaf al-ifada in addition to making sa'y according to Maliki and Hanbali scholars, and by completing the three rites according to Shafi'i scholars.The rulingThere is no legal objection to proceeding to Mecca from Muzdalifa to perform tawaf al-ifada before stoning Jamarat al-'Aqaba and this does not entail any consequences."

    "Answer": "It is impermissible for a man in ihram to wear sewn garments. The legal premise for this impermissibility is the hadith narrated by Ibn 'Umar (may God be pleased with them both) in which he narrated that a man asked the Prophet, \"O Messenger of God! What kind of clothes should a man in ihram wear?\" The Prophet replied, \"He is not to wear shirts, trousers, hooded cloaks or khuff unless he cannot find slippers, in which case he may wear anything that leaves his heels uncovered\" [Recorded by Bukhari and Muslim].From this and other hadiths, scholars deduced the impermissibility of wearing sewn garments which encircle body parts such as those mentioned in the above hadith. There is no harm in wearing other items such as watches, eyeglasses, and the rida` (mantle) or izar that are wrapped around the body but do not accentuate the contours of the body parts they cover.The rulingIt is permissible for a man in ihram for either hajj or 'umrah to wear a sutrah as described above.

    "Question": "What is the ruling if I enter ihram at Medina for hajj tamattu' and fall ill and consequently remove my ihram garments before performing 'umrah?",
    "Answer": "If you fear sudden illness after entering ihram and it is difficult for you to continue the rites of hajj, we advise you to make the intention of istithna` (exception) before entering ihram. You can do this by resolving in your heart and uttering the intention such as by saying, \"I intend to perform 'umrah (or hajj depending on your circumstances). If anything prevents me from its performance, my release from ihram shall be in that place where I am prevented.\"If you do this and are later prevented from completing the rites by a valid excuse, you may release yourself from ihram at the place where you are without the need to go to al-Haram to complete the rites. It suffices to release yourself from ihram from where you are by slaughtering a hady from among the livestock animals and distributing its meat among the poor of the place where you have been prevented from continuing the rites. It is likewise permissible to send the hady to al-Haram to be slaughtered there if possible. You are then to shave or shorten your hair. 'A`isha (may God be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet asked Duba'a Bint al-Zubair, \"Do you intend to perform hajj?\" She replied, \"By God, I did intend to but I am in pain.\" The Prophet told her, \"Perform hajj and set a condition and say, 'O God! I shall release myself from ihram from the place where You prevent me\" [Recorded in the Sahih of Bukhari and Sahih of Muslim].It is incumbent to make the intention to release yourself from ihram when slaughtering as well as for shaving or shortening your hair after slaughtering due to the words of God,And do not shave your heads until the offering reaches the place of sacrifice. [Al-Baqarah, 196]If by your question you mean, removing your ihram garments on account of an illness while remaining in a state of ihram and completing the rites, then this is permissible. However, it is obligatory to slaughter a hady that fulfills the specifications of a sacrificial animal, fast three days or give out in charity three sa's of food that fulfill the requirements of zakat-ul-fitr and distribute them among six of the poor or the impoverished, each receiving half a sa'. Ka'b Ibn 'Ugza (may God be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet told him while on hajj, \"It may be that the lice on your head are troubling you; shave your head and fast three days, feed six impoverished persons or slaughter a sheep or goat\" [Bukhari and Muslim]. This is because of the words of God Who says,And if any of you is ill, or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), (he should) in compensation either fast, or feed the poor or offer sacrifice.

    "Question": "Is it permissible to stone after midnight and what is the manner of determining the time of midnight?",
    "Answer": "Several scholars such as Shafi'i and Hanbali scholars and others have permitted stoning Jamarat al-'Aqaba al-Kubra after midnight of 9th Dhul-Hijjah for the able and unable alike. They based their opinion on the hadith narrated by 'A`isha (may God be pleased with her) who said, \"The Prophet sent Um Salama to throw the pebbles before dawn of 10th Dhul-Hijjah and she afterwards performed tawaf al-ifada [Recorded by Abu Dawud. The hadith meets the criteria laid down by Muslim]. Stoning on the days of tashriqThe established opinion for fatwa is that it is permissible for a pilgrim to stone before midday on all the days of tashriq. This is the opinion of groups of scholars from among the Successors and later scholars. Those who have maintained this opinion, substantiated their opinion on text-proofs which include the report of Ibn 'Abbas (may God be pleased with them both) who said, \"On yawm an-nahr at Mina, the Prophet was asked about several things to which he replied, 'There is no harm.' A man said, 'I shaved my head before slaughtering.' The Prophet replied, 'Slaughter and there is no harm.' Another man said, 'I stoned after sunset.' The Prophet replied, 'There is no harm.' He was not asked about anything on that day that has either been done before or after its time to which he did not reply, 'Do so and there is no harm' \" [Recorded in the Sahih of Bukhari and the Sahih of Muslim. The phrasing of the hadith is Bukhari's]. The evidence from the hadith points to the necessity of lifting harm at the time of stoning. Based on this, it is permissible to stone on the days of tashriq beginning from midnight. Those who wish to leave on the second and third nights of the days of tashriq may do so.Since night starts at sunset and ends at true dawn, midnight is calculated by dividing this period by two and adding the result to the beginning of the time of maghrib."

    "Question": "What is the legal ruling for a pilgrim with special needs and one with a mental or physical handicap performing the obligatory Hajj?",
    "Answer": "Like the ruling for a healthy person who meets the condition of capability, a person with a physical disability who fulfills the same condition, is obliged to perform Hajj, either by themselves or by commissioning another to perform it on their behalf. This is based on the words of God the Almighty Who says,And [due] to God from the people is a pilgrimage to the House - for whoever is able to find thereto a way (Quran 3:97)The same ruling applies to a person with a mental disability whose condition does not render them legally irresponsible. This includes those whose mental (and not actual) age is equivalent to that of a mature and discernible person of 15 years or above, or even below, but who (according to specialists) is aware of physical matters related to the opposite gender similar to one who has reached puberty. This applies whether the disability is both physical and mental or mental alone. The Hajj of such a person is valid and fulfills the obligation, whether they perform it out of their own finances or someone else pays for it.The Hajj (or 'Umrah) of a person whose mental disability renders them legally irresponsible as outlined above, is valid if they are accompanied to the holy sites and perform the rites and observe the conditions of Hajj or Umrah with the help of another. Such a person will earn the reward of Hajj (or 'Umrah), though it does not fulfill the obligation of an obligatory Hajj or 'Umrah (for those who maintain that 'Umrah is obligatory, such as the Shafi'is). This means that mentally disabled people, whose condition renders them legally irresponsible, must perform the obligatory Hajj and 'Umrah if they recover and become legally responsible."

    "Question": "What does hajj ifrad, qiran, and tamattu' mean?",
    "Answer": "There are three ways of performing hajj: ifrad, qiran, and tamattu'.IfradAccording to some scholars such as the Shafi'is, ifrad is performing hajj before 'umrah by entering ihram for hajj first from the designated miqat, finishing the rites of hajj, leaving Mecca for al-Hill to assume ihram for 'umrah and then performing its rites. For hajj ifrad, some scholars do not stipulate making 'umrah after hajj and consider that hajj ifrad is accomplished by performing the rites of hajj alone (without subsequently performing 'umrah).QiranQiran means entering ihram for hajj and 'umrah simultaneously, or entering ihram for 'umrah and subsequently incorporating the intention to perform hajj into the intention for 'umrah before beginning the rites of 'umrah. A pilgrim then performs the rites of hajj, fulfilling the obligation for both hajj and 'umrah.Tamattu'Tamattu' means performing 'umrah first before subsequently entering ihram for hajj, so called because a pilgrim on hajj tamattu' is allowed to do the things that are unlawful for a person in ihram in the period between 'umrah and hajj.A pilgrim on hajj ifrad is not obliged to slaughter, though he may do so if he wishes. But a pilgrim on hajj qiran or tamattu' must slaughter and the reason for this obligation is the omission of entering ihram for hajj from the miqat site for people of his country.There is a scholarly debate on the best way to perform hajj. According to the Maliki and Shafi'i scholars, the best is hajj ifrad. Maliki scholars have maintained that it is followed by qiran and then tamattu' while the Shafi'is said that it is followed by tamattu' and then qiran. According to the Hanafis, the best of the three is qiran, followed by tamattu' and then ifrad while the Hanbalis maintain that tamattu' is best followed by ifrad and then qiran.We recommend that pilgrims choose whichever way is easier for them.And God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What are the things which nullify hajj?",
    "Answer": "Hajj is not nullified except by engaging in sexual intercourse or sexual foreplay before making partial release from ihram (state of pilgrim sanctity). This is based on the words of God Almighty Who says, “Let there be no sexual relations [with your wives], nor transgressions, nor wrangling in the hajj” (Quran 2: 197).Engaging in sexual intercourse is not a reason to discontinue hajj and a pilgrim who does this is to complete the rest of the rites and perform a make-up hajj and sacrifice an animal the following year. Hajj is not nullified for a pilgrim who engages in sexual intercourse after partial release from ihram and before full release from it, though he is obliged to make expiation.Continuing an act of worship which has become nullified is particular only to hajj and does not extend to other acts of worship.A pilgrim who misses standing at 'Arafat, has forfeited his hajj due to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) who said, \"The hajj is 'Arafat.\" A pilgrim must release himself from ihram for hajj by performing 'umrah instead, and is obliged to perform a make-up hajj and slaughter an animal the following year.And God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What are the conditions for the obligatoriness of hajj?",
    "Answer": "1- Islam.2- Maturity.3- Sanity.4- Freedom.5- Capability. It is a condition for a pilgrim to have provisions (i.e. for food and medicine) and transport expenses. It is likewise a condition that the provisions and transport expenses be in surplus of the needs of his family and dependents. A person who owns a sum which he uses for trade and from the profit of which he supports his dependents, does not meet this condition if his trade is affected by any reduction in the capital sum. Such a person is not obliged to make hajj if his profits are reduced to the extent that he is unable to meet obligatory expenses if he makes the journey from this capital sum. But if his capital is more than his obligatory expenses, then he fulfills the condition of capability and he is to take from his capital what suffices the expenses of hajj.Marriage takes precedence over hajj for an unmarried person who possesses the financial means but needs to marry to maintain his chastity.It is permissible for a person who possesses enough funds to cover his travel expenses and to cover the expenses of his dependents during his absence, but who does not have enough money for himself during the hajj period, to work in jobs that are associated with the rites of hajj such as driving buses to transport pilgrims from one site to another. Such a person does not meet the condition of capability and is not obliged to perform hajj. But if he does, it is permissible and he fulfills the obligation.6- Physical tolerance to help the pilgrim endure the hardships associated with travel.7- It is obligatory for a pilgrim to take a safe route to preserve his safety, honor and property.8- Have sufficient time to reach Mecca to perform the rites at their prescribed times without undue hurry, especially standing at 'Arafat.And God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "A physically disabled man whose left leg is shorter than the right compensates for this shortage by wearing orthopedic shoes. Is it permissible for him to wear these shoes during the rites of hajj, such as tawaf and sa'y, which are performed inside the Sacred Mosque? Would this obligate him to make fidya? Are the shoelaces considered sewn garments?",
    "Answer": "In such a case as that mentioned in the question, it is permissible to wear orthopedic shoes with laces because it is a necessity and necessity renders prohibited things lawful. The inquirer, for whom it is necessary to wear orthopedic shoes, must make fidya by doing one of the following:- Fast three days; or- Feed six impoverished persons or give out the value of a meal to each person; or- Slaughter a sheep or goat.This is analogous to the fidya made by a person who covers his head during hajj because of an illness or any harm that might befall him. God the Almighty says:And if any of you is ill, or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), (he should) in compensation either fast, or feed the poor, or offer sacrifice (Quran 2:196)."

    "Answer": "The opinion of Hanafi, Maliki, and Hanbali scholars is that it is impermissible to slaughter an animal due to hajj tamattu' (performing ‘umrah before hajj) or qiran (performing hajj and ‘umrah simultaneously) except on the days of slaughter i.e. the day of 'Eid and the three following days. However, according to the Shafi'is, the obligatory sacrifice due to committing one of the restrictions of ihram (state of pilgrim sanctity) or omitting an integral is not restricted to a particular time.

    "Question": "Is it legally permissible for pilgrims to depart from 'Arafat in stages to facilitate the departure of their increasingly great numbers? Is this considered changing the rites of hajj?",
    "Answer": "The majority of scholars have concurred that:• It is valid to stand at 'Arafat any time after midday.• The time for standing there ends by the break of dawn of yawm an-nahr.• It is valid to stand at 'Arafat for part of the day and night after midday and there is no problem for a person who does this. They differed on two issues: 1- The ruling for standing at 'Arafat and departing before midday and whether this is a valid substitute for standing until after midday. The majority of scholars have maintained that this does not suffice and that whoever does so must go back and stand on the plain of 'Arafat after midday (zawal) or spend a portion of that night until before dawn, otherwise he will have forfeited his hajj. Hanbali scholars have maintained in their legal school that this suffices and that the hajj of a pilgrim who does so is valid.2- Whether it is sufficient to stand on the plain of 'Arafat and depart before sunset.Hanafi scholars and those who agree with them, consider it obligatory to stand at 'Arafat until sunset. The most valid opinion for the Shafi'is and those who agree with them is that standing at 'Arafat until sunset is recommended and not obligatory. They maintained that it is permissible for a pilgrim who was standing at 'Arafat before the sun has passed its zenith to depart before sunset. Proponents of the second opinion of both matters substantiate their opinions with the hadith narrated by 'Urwa Ibn Madras (may God be pleased with him) who said, \"I approached the Messenger of God at Muzdalifa when he was going for [the 'Eid] prayer and said, 'O Messenger of God! I have come from the mountains of Tayi`. I have exhausted my mount and worn myself out! By God, I did not come across any hill without halting there. Have I therefore accomplished my hajj?' The Prophet said, 'Whoever offers this prayer of ours, stands with us until we depart (and had stood at 'Arafat beforehand, whether by night or day), has accomplished his hajj and performed its rites \" [Recorded by Imam Ahmed and the authors of the Sunan (Imams Bukhari, Muslim, at-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, al-Nisa`i and Ibn Majah). At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Habban, al-Darqutni and al-Hakim declared it authentic. After mentioning the hadith in Muntaqa Al-Akhbar, the Hanbali scholarAbu Barakat Ibn Taymiya wrote, \"This is proof that the entire daytime of the day of 'Arafat is the time allotted for standing at 'Arafat.\" The rulingIt is possible for the responsible authorities to organize the departure and coming forth of the pilgrims from 'Arafat in a manner suitable to their numbers and that prevents overcrowding. It is permissible for them to make the pilgrims' departure in two or more stages, as required by their general welfare."

    "Answer": "The established opinion for fatwa during our times when the volume of pilgrims has greatly increased, is that staying overnight at Muzdalifa is but a praiseworthy recommendation. This is the opinion of Imam Shafi'i as expressed in his books Al-Umm and Al-Imla` and an opinion of Imam Ahmed. Maliki scholars find it sufficient to stipulate being present at Muzdalifa for only a period equivalent to the time it takes a pilgrim to unload his luggage and pray the shortened maghrib and 'isha prayers together. The majority of scholars, who maintain the obligation of staying overnight at Muzdalifa, waive this obligation in the case of an excuse. Protecting lives from imminent or possible danger is an example of such an excuse. Therefore, the dense crowds and the build-up of human traffic which are characteristic of present day hajj, is a legal excuse for not staying overnight at Muzdalifa according to those scholars who obligate it."

    "Answer": "If you are going on hajj tamattu' or qiran, then it is obligatory to slaughter a hady in al-Haram (Mecca, Mina, Muzdalifa or in any of the sites called al-Haram). This is what is obligatory, but what is recommended for you to do (you are rewarded for performing it but refraining from performing it entails no consequences), is to slaughter any kind of livestock animal and distribute its meat in charity among the poor of al-Haram and the surrounding areas.It is likewise recommended to offer a sacrifice because, according to the opinion of the majority of scholars, sacrificial animals are recommended for both a pilgrim and others though it is not associated with al-Haram. Therefore, you may slaughter in al-Haram, Egypt or any other place where Muslims are in need such as Palestine, Somalia or elsewhere."

    "Answer": "Organized hajj and 'umrah trips, the expenses of which are pre-determined and agreed upon by both parties, are merely an agreement over a benefit or over the benefit from an item and this is legally permissible.

In such a case, it is permissible to include a third party for funding, agency, or brokerage purposes. It is likewise permissible for the funding party to pay in cash and receive the price from the client in installments with an increase in price in exchange for deferment.In such a case as when the contract is revoked, the money is returned to the client who recovers the installments he has paid but did not benefit from.

    "Question": "I am an Egyptian living and working in Saudi Arabia. My money accumulates and increases over the year. For instance, the sum at the beginning of the year is 20.000 SAR which increases monthly at a fixed rate. If the total sum after the passage of the year becomes 80.000 SAR, should zakat be paid on the total sum?My other questions are: Should I pay my zakat in the country of my residence or in Egypt? What is the legal ruling for my wife who cannot fast in Ramadan because she will be in her third month of pregnancy?",
    "Answer": "Zakat on money is due if the owner of a property:1. Possesses the minimum amount upon which zakat is owed (nisab) or more;2. one lunar year has passed.Based on this and in reference to the example mentioned by the petitioner, zakat should be paid on the total sum of 80.000 SAR after the passage of the lunar year which is the easiest way to pay zakat. If you want to pay zakat on each sum separately when one year has passed, there is no legal objection to doing so.The principal is that zakat be paid in one's country of residence unless there is a benefit in doing otherwise, such as wishing to give it to someone in dire need or one of your relatives in your country; since the reward for giving zakat to a relative who is not one of your dependents is doubled.The second answer: if your wife fears for herself, or fears for both herself and the fetus, she must only make up for the missed fast days and she does not have to pay fidyah (En. penalty fee paid for missing fast days without an excuse). However, if she only fears for the fetus, especially if specialized physicians warned her that fasting may harm it, she must then make up for missed fast days and pay fidyah: it is to pay a mudd (0.51 liters) of food to the poor for each missed day of fasting. A mudd is one quarter of a saa' which means one quarter of the amount paid for zakat al-fitr including grains or dates or the like that fulfills the obligation.God Almighty knows best."

[Please] take into account that we follow the Hanafi school of jurisprudence.",
    "Answer": "It is established in Hanafi jurisprudence that the amount of Zakat al-Fitr is half a sa' of wheat, wheat flour, a mixture of wheat and barley flour, or raisins, or one sa' of dates or barley. - A sa' is the measure of the region with the capacity of four mudds. - A mudd is the measure of two open medium-sized handfuls; according to the Hanafis its amount equals two Iraqi ritls. - According to the Hanafis, an Iraqi ritl is half a mann; a mann is 260 dirhams. - According to the Hanafis, a dirham is three and one eighths of a gram (3.125).Based on the above, according to the Hanafis, the mann is equivalent to 3.125×260= eight hundred and twelve and a half of a gram (812.5) which is also equivalent to two Iraqi ritls. Therefore, the measure of four mudds is: 4×812.5= three kilograms and a quarter (3.25).Based on this and in reference to the question, according to the Hanafis, half a sa' fulfills the obligation of Zakat al-Fitr for whoever wants to give it out as wheat, wheat flour, a mixture of wheat and barley flour, or raisins which is equivalent to 1.625 kgs; One sa', which is equivalent to 3.250 kgs fulfills the obligation of Zakat al-Fitr for whoever wishes to give it out as dates or barley.Allah knows best."

Is the ruling the same for a property purchased with the intention of keeping it as a private residence but which I sold due to a change in my circumstances? In the latter case, is zakat calculated on the profit made in the last year?",
    "Answer": "Zakat is one of the pillars of Islam. It is due upon a Muslim whose wealth has reached nisab [minimum amount upon which zakat is due] which is the equivalent of 85 grams of 21 carat gold; must be in surplus of the needs of the zakat payer and his dependents and its amount is one quarter of a tenth (i.e. 2.5%) of its worth. Any debts are to be deducted before calculating zakat which is only due upon the remaining sum.Based on the above and in reference to the question, since the plot of land was purchased with the purpose of investment, zakat is paid upon the sale price i.e. on the last year of its possession without waiting for a lunar year to pass on its possession and the zakat amount is 2.5%. This is the opinion of Imam Malik ibn Anas and the opinion chosen for fatwa on this issue.No zakat is due upon a property purchased for private residence. If circumstances change and the property is sold, zakat is due only on the profit if it reaches nisab, after one lunar year passes and after deducting any debts.Allah Almighty knows best."

However, sometimes, it becomes mandatory to give charity to non-Muslims since it is obligatory in Islamic law to fulfill the needs of the other if no means but him available to do so. As for zakat, it must be paid to Muslims only.As for giving zakah money to a hospital, it is not important to know if all patients are Muslims. This is because benefiting from an entity after it is already established differs from dealing with its ownership in the first place. This is compared to a case of a poor Muslim who received zakah money to host a non-Muslim guest. Therefore, it is unanimously agreed to give zakah to hospitals in general."

    "Question": "- What is the ruling for women and the weak from among the pilgrims not spending the night at Mina?- What is the ruling for commissioning others to stone on their behalf?",
    "Answer": "Preservation of the self is one of the objectives of Islamic lawThe importance of an individual's well-being is reflected in the universal axioms of Islamic law of which one of the most important is that ‘repelling a harm is superior to securing a benefit’. It follows from this that the welfare of Muslims is a fundamental principle in Islamic law and that any conflict of interest needs to be resolved or promoted according to its importance.Hajj is one of the pillars of IslamGod has made Hajj obligatory only upon those who are able to undertake it. Due to the sanctity of human life, Islamic law has made it a legal duty to preserve the lives of pilgrims. Ibn 'Abbas said, \"When the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) looked at the Ka'ba, he said, 'Welcome O blessed House! How great you are and how great your sanctity, though the sanctity of a believer is greater in the eyes of God!' \" (Al-Bayhaqi).Spending the night at Mina—a scholarly debateThere is a scholarly debate regarding the obligation of staying overnight in Mina on the three days following Hajj (Ayam at-tashreeq). The majority of scholars from the Shafi'i, Hanbali, and Maliki scholars maintain that it is obligatory while the Hanafis maintain that it is a sunna.Evidence for the permissibility of not staying overnight in Mina - The Hanafi luminary, al-Mirghani, said in al-Hidaya: \"It is disliked to neglect staying overnight in Mina on the days of stoning because this was something that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) observed [on his Hajj] … In our opinion, if a pilgrim deliberately spends the night at another place, he is not obliged to make expiation for this omission because spending the night at Mina was only legislated to facilitate the stoning for pilgrims; it is not among the [obligatory] acts of Hajj.\"- Ibn 'Umar (may God be pleased with them both) reported that 'Abbas (may God be pleased with him) sought permission from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to spend the nights of Mina at Mecca since he was responsible for supplying the pilgrims with water; the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) granted him permission. If it had been obligatory to stay overnight at Mina, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would not have granted him permission. Therefore, it has become known that it a recommendation.\"- Imam Malik relates in his Muwatta` through 'Asem ibn 'Adiyy (may God be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) gave the camel shepherds permission to spend the night outside Mina. He allowed them to stone on the day of Slaughter, to combine two days' stoning on the next day and then stone on the day of their departure. Staying overnight at Mina not being an obligation—the chosen opinion for fatwaIt was reported that staying overnight at Mina is not legislated for no purpose but for a rational reason, mainly the comfort of the pilgrims due to its proximity to the place where they will stone the next day. For this reason, it is not obligatory. If we add to the above the extreme weariness of the pilgrims, the crowds and the fear of the spread of diseases, then the chosen opinion for fatwa is that it is not an obligation but a sunnah.A necessary measure for contemporary HajjAt present it has become necessary to facilitate rulings concerning Hajj since it is only wise to take into consideration the risk of spreading [infectious] diseases and epidemics, thus conforming to the objective of Islamic law of preserving human life. This is especially so in crowded areas and in matters which God has left room for His servants to perform to the best of their abilities.It is known that obligating pilgrims to stay overnight at Mina along with the other rites of Hajj only increases their exhaustion and compromises their ability to ward off epidemics and fatal diseases which easily spread in crowded areas. Moreover, there is no doubt that women, children, the weak and ill are the most susceptible to such harm, so it is only fitting that the permissibility of omitting the overnight stay at Mina be extended to them especially since all the followed schools of jurisprudence maintain that it is not among the pillars of Hajj.Commissioning another to stone on one's behalfIt is permissible to stone on behalf of the weak, the sick and women. The basis for this is that it is permissible to make Hajj on behalf of another. This is a dispensation for those who are ill or have an excuse preventing them from staying overnight at Mina.For this reason, many scholars include grounds other than those mentioned in [classical] texts by interpreting this issue in light of Islam's fundamental principles (in this case facilitating things for the weak and sick) such as those who fear for themselves or for their property, a caregiver, or those who supervise the needs of pilgrims.Imam al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu' [8/219-20]: \"Imam al-Shafi'i and his students (may God have mercy on them) said that a person who is unable to make the stoning himself because he is ill, cannot reach the stoning site or for another reason is to commission another to stone on his behalf.\"The RulingIt is permissible for the weak, the ill and women not to stay overnight at Mina; it is likewise permissible for them to commission others to stone on their behalf. There is no objection to this and they are not obliged to make expiation.God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Is it obligatory for a pilgrim to slaughter his hady in al-Haram or is it permissible to slaughter it outside al-Haram? Is it permissible to slaughter it in Malaysia and distribute the meat among the poor and the impoverished both inside and outside Malaysia?",
    "Answer": "First, it is impermissible for a pilgrim on hajj tamattu' to slaughter a hady in his country before going to Mecca for hajj. This is because the place for slaughtering is al-Haram. God the Almighty says,Such (is his state): and whoever holds in honor the rites of God (in the sacrifice animals), such (honor) should come truly from piety of heart. In them ye have benefits for a term appointed: In the end their place of sacrifice is near the Ancient House. [Al-Hajj, 32-3]The rulingIt is necessary for a pilgrim to slaughter his hady in Mecca. As for distributing the meat of these offerings, the principle is to distribute them among the poor of al-Haram. There is no harm in saving the meat and distributing it among them over the course of the year. If the amount of meat exceeds their needs for the current year as well as for the next, then it is permissible to distribute it among the poor in places other than al-Haram."

    "Question": "How can the woman perform hajj in her menstruation or postnatal bleeding?",
    "Answer": "- ‘Abdullah Ibn 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab (may God be pleased with them both) said, \"A menstruating woman on hajj or ‘umrah may enter ihram if she wishes, but is not to make tawaf or sa'y. She is to perform all the rites with the rest of the pilgrims except for tawaf and sa'y and she is required to refrain from entering the Mosque until she is pure.\"1- lady 'A`isha (may God be pleased with her) narrated, \"We went out with the Prophet for the Farewell Pilgrimage. Some of us had assumed ihram for 'umrah and others for hajj. When we reached Mecca, the Messenger of God said, ‘Whoever has entered ihram for 'umrah and does not have a hady (animal driven to the scared land for expiation or to gain the pleasure of God), is to release himself from ihram; whoever has entered ihram for 'umrah and has a hady with him must not release himself from ihram until he slaughters his hady; and whoever has assumed ihram for hajj, must complete his hajj.\" She added, “I was in a state of menstruation and remained in this state until the day of 'Arafat. I had only assumed ihram for 'umrah so the Prophet ordered me to undo my hair and comb it and enter ihram for hajj, omitting my 'umrah. I followed his orders and after we had performed hajj, the Prophet sent Abdul-Rahman Ibn Abu Bakr with me to al-Tan'eem to start my 'umrah.\"2- In another narration, 'A`isha said, \"I was still menstruating when I reached Mecca. I did not make tawaf or sa'y. When I informed the Messenger of God of this, he said, “Do what other pilgrims do except for tawaf and sa'y until you become pure.\"3- 'A`isha (may God be pleased with her) said, \"Asma` bint 'Umays was in a state of postnatal bleeding after giving birth to Mohammed Ibn Abu Bakr. The Messenger of God ordered Abu Bakr to command her to take a purifactory bath and enter ihram.\"4 - Ibn 'Umar (may God be pleased with them both) narrated, \"Whoever performs hajj must perform tawaf al-wada' (farewell circumambulation) as the last rite except for menstruating women because the Messenger permitted them not to perform it.\"5It is permissible for a woman in menstruation or postnatal bleeding and those in a state of ritual impurity to do all the rites of hajj except for tawaf and praying the two rak'ahs of tawaf. Therefore, the ihram of a woman in menstruation or postnatal bleeding is valid although it is recommended that she bathe first. It is likewise permissible for women in these two states to have the baths that are recommended during hajj, to stand at 'Arafat, and do other rites due to the words of the Prophet, \"Do what pilgrims do except for tawaf.\"Based on this, a woman in menstruation or postnatal bleeding must continue the rites of hajj and refrain from making tawaf until she is pure. Concerning a woman who fears that her companions may depart before she performs tawaf and cannot wait until she is pure from menstruation, some scholars have maintained that it is permissible for her to circumambulate the Ka'bah while wearing a sanitary pad to prevent her from soiling the mosque. As for tawaf al-wada', it is permissible for a woman to omit it.5 Recorded by Al-Tirmidhi (958) who declared it fair and authentic. -------------------------------------------------------1 Recorded by Malik (760).2 Recorded by Bukhari (320) and Muslim (2969).3 Recorded by Bukhari (1676) and Muslim (2977).4 Recorded by Muslim (2966)."

    "Answer": "If you are going on hajj tamattu' or qiran, then it is obligatory to slaughter in al-Haram (Mecca, Mina, Muzdalifa or in any of the sites inside al-Haram). This is what is obligatory, but what is recommended for you to do (you are rewarded for performing it but refraining from performing it entails no consequences), is to slaughter any kind of livestock animal and distribute its meat in charity among the poor of al-Haram and the surrounding areas.It is a sunna to offer a sacrifice because, according to the opinion of the majority of scholars, sacrificial animals are recommended for both pilgrims and non-pilgrims though it is not associated with al-Haram. Therefore, you may slaughter in al-Haram, Egypt or any other place where Muslims are in need such as Palestine, Somalia or elsewhere."

    "Question": "Is it permissible for a pilgrim—male or female—to cover themselves for warmth?",
    "Answer": "It is not permissible for a male person in ihram for 'umrah to wear anything that is sewn or encircles the body parts they cover such as shirts, trousers, shorts, footwear that covers the heel bones and the like. However, there is no harm in covering a body part with anything that has not been specifically designed for this purpose i.e. wrapping a shirt or blanket around his body to keep warm, cover his nakedness and so forth. The opinion concerning the obligation of making fidya for wearing sewn garments concerns wearing them in the manner for which they were intended and not merely for covering the body with them.It is impermissible for a pilgrim in a state of ihram for 'umrah or hajj to cover all or part of his head, even the area behind his ears with anything that clings to it, whether it is sewn and circles the head such as caps and hats; not sewn such as turbans or the izar; and everything that is generally considered a covering. There is no harm if he covers his head with a pillow, puts his hands on his head, or uses an umbrella even if it touches his head. There is a scholarly debate on the permissibility of a pilgrim carrying something on his head; therefore, it is preferable not to do this to avoid making fidya according to the opinion of those scholars who prohibit this.The ihram for a woman in ihram for hajj or 'umrah, is confined to her face and hands both of which must remain uncovered. She may wear whatever she pleases and cover her head with whatever she pleases.The rulingThere is no harm if a pilgrim on hajj or 'umrah covers himself for warmth provided he does not wear anything that accentuates his body parts or covers his head."

    "Question": "Is the husband’s permission necessary for his wife to travel in order to perform the Hajj?",
    "Answer": "Mutual understanding, agreement, love, and mercy should be the foundations of a Muslim household. The husband and the wife should always be pleased with each other. This is the ideal to which we wish all Muslim households would adhere. Women are responsible just like men. The Prophet said, “There is no obedience to a created being that involves disobedience to the Creator.” Neglecting to perform the Hajj when one is able, is to neglect one of the pillars of the religion. It is not permissible for her husband to order her not to go on Hajj and it is sinful for him to do so. If he does, she should not obey him and if she goes on Hajj in disobedience to him she would not be committing a sin.To begin with a woman does not need her husband’s permission to worship her Lord. If she is going to fast in Ramadan she can do so without her husband’s permission, similarly if she wants to pray, make Hajj, or pay zakat. Her husband is not an overseer of her relationship with her Lord.Even if she wanted to make the lesser pilgrimage, which is mandatory according to the Shafi’is and the Hanbalis, her husband’s refusal would not prevent her. But we advise that this is better done by means of mutual understanding and agreement or else marital life would be about hardship, strife, and conflict.Ibn Qudamah confirms this ruling when he says, “The entirety of it is that if a women gets into the ihram for an obligatory Hajj or umrah, which is the Hajj or umrah of Islam or one based on an oath, then her husband cannot prevent her from carrying it out, and he cannot take her out of ihram in the opinion of most of the people of knowledge including Ahmad, al-Nakha’i, Ishaq, the people of reason, and al-Shafi’i in the most correct of his two opinions.” Based on this, the husband’s discontent and his refusal to give permission has no effect on his wife’s Hajj and does not impose anything upon her. But it is better for their lives to be based on mutual contentment and agreement, as we mentioned. And God is Most High and Knows Best."

His wife went ahead with the plans and took her brother both as her mahram [unmarriageable male relative] and to perform hajj on behalf of my brother. She deducted the expenses of their hajj from my brother's estate, over which she had control, and before its division. Please note that my brother does not have any children but is survived by one full sister. Some Azhari scholars in our village explained to my brother's widow that her hajj expenses must be covered from her lawful share and not from the estate as a whole, but she refused. She likewise refused to commission one of our relatives living in Saudi Arabia to perform hajj on behalf of my brother. Please clarify the legal ruling for this.",
    "Answer": "The woman mentioned in the question is not entitled to deduct the expenses of her hajj from her husband's estate before its division. She must return the sum she took without seeking the permission of the legal heirs because her late husband only promised her to take her on hajj—and a promise is not legally binding i.e. it cannot be used as evidence in a dispute. Had her husband been alive, he may have revoked his promise for any reason. Moreover, financial rights are not acknowledged unless they are established by determinant evidence, written or drawn up in the presence of witnesses.- If the deceased had not performed his obligatory hajj before his death, its expenses must be deducted from the estate before its division. -The hajj performed by the brother-in-law is valid if he has already performed his own obligatory hajj. However, not all its expenses are to be deducted from the estate, but only the minimum sum which would have been spent had the relative residing in Saudi Arabia performed hajj on behalf of the deceased; the rest belongs to the heirs. Anything beyond this must be covered by the brother-in-law and not deducted from the estate. -If the brother-in-law had not performed his obligatory hajj, he is responsible for the expenses and, by this hajj, has fulfilled the obligatory hajj for himself and not for the deceased. -If the deceased had already performed his obligatory hajj, the expenses of the hajj performed by his brother-in-law on his behalf is not to be deducted from the estate except if any of the heirs volunteers to pay them from his share. -The hajj of the widow of the deceased and her brother is valid if they preserve the heirs' rights as mentioned above.

    "Question": "What is the ruling for a group reading of surat Al-Kahf on Fridays? Some people object to this practice maintaining that it contravenes Islamic law.",
    "Answer": "Reciting the Qu`ran in a group is a matter sanctioned by Islamic law due to the generality of evidences on its recommendation. Evidence from the Qur`anSurely, those who recite the Book of Allah and establish prayer and spend [in His cause] out of what We have provided them, secretly and publicly, [can] expect a profit that will never perish. [Fatir,: 29]Evidence from the sunnahThe Prophetsaid, \"Recite the Qur`an for it will intercede for its readers on the Day of Judgment\" [recorded by Muslim from a hadith narrated by Abu Umama al-Bahliy (may Allah be pleased with him)].It is established in Islamic legal thought that an absolute command demands its unqualified application with regards to people, conditions, times and places. When Allah the Almighty legislates a matter in general ('am) or absolute (mutlaq) terms, it must be applied as such and it is not permissible to specify or restrict it in any way except with evidence from Islamic law. Being oblivious to this would result in innovation in religious matters, and create unnecessary hardship in issues which Allah and His Messenger made capacious.The fact that the Prophet practiced certain aspects of restricted or unrestricted acts does not in itself specify the general or limit the absolute as long as he did not prohibit the acts he refrained from doing. This was expressed by Islamic theorists who coined the axiom, 'Absence is not proof' i.e. the fact that the Prophet did not perform a certain action does not evidence its impermissibility. And this axiom is one that is agreed upon by all scholars from the salaf[1] and khalaf[2].Imam Abu Zakariya Yehya an-Nawawi dedicated a rich and beneficial chapter in his copious book At-Tibyan fi Adab Hamalat Al-Qur`an to this issue and entitled it \"The virtue of reading the Qur`an in congregation, the virtue of those who read it in a group and the virtue of its listeners and of the one who gathers people and invites and encourages them to recite it.\" He wrote,\"Know that reciting the Qur`an in a group is a recommended act based on explicit evidences and the practice of the salaf and the khalaf. It has been authentically reported from Abu Huraira and Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet said, 'There is no group of people who make remembrance of Allah save that the angels surround them, mercy envelopes them, tranquility descends upon them and Allah mentions them to those in His presence' [At-Tirmidhi declared this a good and sound hadith].Abu Huraira related that the Prophetsaid, 'No people gather in a house from the houses of Allah (the mosques), reciting the Qur`an and studying it amongst themselves, except that tranquility descends upon them, mercy envelopes them, the angels surround them and Allah mentions them to those in His presence' [recorded by Muslim and Abu Dawud with an authentic ascription according to the criteria laid down by Bukhari and Muslim].Mu'awiah related that the Prophet went up to a group of people from among his Companions and asked, 'Why are you sitting [together]?' The responded, 'We sat together to make remembrance of Allah, praise Him for guiding us to Islam and for favoring us with its blessings.' The Prophetsaid, 'Gabriel, peace be upon him, came to me and informed me that Allah boasts about you before the angels' [recorded by At-Tirmidhi and an-Nasa`i. At-Tirmidhi declared it fair and authentic]. The number of texts that illustrate this are many.- Al-Darimiy related with a chain to Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) who said, \"Whoever listens to a verse from the Book of Allah (the Qur`an), it shall be a light for him.\"- Ibn Abu Dawud related that Abu Darda` (may Allah be pleased with him) would lead a group of people in Qur`anic recitation.- Ibn Abu Dawud related that some of the greatest scholars from among the salaf and khalaf and some of the judges that preceded his time studied the Qur`an in congregation.- It was reported that Hassan Ibn 'Atiyya and al-Awza'iy said, \"The first to introduce the practice of reading the Qur`an in Damascus mosque was Hisham Ibn Ismai'il after he went to Ali 'Abdul-Malik.- Ibn Abu Dawud reported from Al-Dahhak Ibn 'Abdul-Rahman Ibn 'Arzab that the latter repudiated this practice and said, \"I did not see or hear anything of the sort though I was a contemporary of the Prophet's Companions\" i.e. I did not see any of them doing this.- It was reported that Wahb said, \"I told Malik, 'Do you approve of people assembling to recite a sura until they complete it?' He disapproved of this and said,\" This is not what the salaf did; they would recite the Qur`an to one another.\"This repudiation from both al-Dahhak and Malik is antithetical to the practice of the salaf and khalaf. [It is best] to avoid what is without evidence and rely on the above evidences that recommend [reciting the Qur`an in a group]. However, there are certain conditions which must be observed for such a recitation. Allah the Almighty knows best.\"The virtue of gathering people to recite the Qur`anThere are numerous textual evidences for this and these include: The Prophet said, \"The one who guides to good is (rewarded) like the one who performs it.\""

    "Answer": "Reciting the Qur`an before the adhanAllah the Almighty rewards the person who recites the Qur`an abundantly, elevates his rank and exhorts Muslims to recite it and contemplate its meanings.Evidence from Qur`anAllah the Almighty says,Thy Lord doth know that thou standest forth (to prayer) nigh two-thirds of the night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and so doth a party of those with thee. But Allah doth appoint night and day in due measure He knoweth that ye are unable to keep count thereof. So He hath turned to you (in mercy): read ye, therefore, of the Qur'an as much as may be easy for you. He knoweth that there may be (some) among you in ill-health; others travelling through the land, seeking of Allah's bounty; yet others fighting in Allah's Cause, read ye, therefore, as much of the Qur'an as may be easy (for you); and establish regular Prayer and give regular Charity; and loan to Allah a Beautiful Loan. And whatever good ye send forth for your souls ye shall find it in Allah's Presence, - yea, better and greater, in Reward and seek ye the Grace of Allah. For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.[Al-Muzzammil: 20]Evidence from the sunnahProphet Mohammed said, \"Read the Qur'an, for indeed it will come on the Day of Resurrection to intercede on behalf of its reciters.Recite the two bright ones, Al-Baqarah and Al-'Imran, for on the Day of Resurrection, they will come as two clouds or shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for the [cause] of their reciters.Recite Surat Al-Baqarahfor to take recourse to it is a blessing and to give it up is a cause of grief, and magicians have no power over them.\"[1]The Prophet said, \"Read the Qur`an, for Allah does not torture the person who comprehends it.\"[2] Listening to the Qur`an—an act of worship Allah has made listening to the holy Qur`an an an act of worship and promised a great reward for it. The Prophet said, \"Whoever listens to even one verse of the Qur'an earns a two-fold reward; and for the one who recites a single verse, it is a light for him on the Day of Resurrection.\"[3]Islam recommends reciting the Qur`an every day, especially on Fridays, by reading Surat Al-Kahf. The Prophet said, \"Whoever recites Surat Al-Kahf on the eve of Friday, a light will stretch between him and the Ka’ba.\"[4] Reciting the Qur` in a pleasant voice It is recommended to recite the Qur`an eloquently and in a pleasant voice for the Prophet said, \"Adorn the Qur`an with your voices, for indeed a pleasant voice enhances the beauty of the Qur`an.\"[5]The rulingBased on the above, there is no objection to reciting the Qur`an in mosques before the Friday prayer. It is a desirable act that brings people together for the purpose of reciting the Qur`an and prepares them for the rituals of Friday prayer.Allah the Almighty knows best.

    "Question": "the ruling for reciting Surat al-Sajdah regularly on the dawn of Friday.",
    "Answer": "It was mentioned in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim that the Prophet [pbuh] used to recite surat Al-Sajdah and surat Al-Insan during the dawn Prayer of Friday. Al-Tabarani likewise reported that the Prophet [pbuh] used to recite them regularly during that same time. This counters the argument of those who deny that these two Qur`anic chapters are to be recited regularly during the Dawn prayer of Friday and the claim made by those who maintain that it is a Sunnah not to follow the actions of the Prophet [pbuh]. In its widest sense, this is an erroneous assumption and if taken literally, would appear contradictory.The mustahab, mandub and sunnahThese include those actions that the Prophet ordered to be done though they are not classified under obligatory actions; they are those actions which the Prophet ordered to be performed and the negligence of which is not mustahab [desirable]. However, it is mustahab to refrain from doing those actions that are considered makruh [those actions that are disliked but do not fall under the prohibited]. The practice of the CompanionsThe Companions used to act upon the mustahab and mandub [recommended] actions practiced by the Prophet [pbuh] as if they were obligatory. In an effort to emulate all the actions of the Prophet [pbuh], they used to practice these acts on a continuous basis and admonish those from among them who neglected them. Some of the Companions even went as far as to emulate the Prophet's dispositions and personal tastes. Ibn abu Shaybah reported in al-Musannaf that al-Sha'bi said: \"I have not seen Ibn 'Abbas recite any chapter on Friday except \"Tanzeel\" (al-Sajdah) and \"Hal ata\" (al-Insan).\"The meaning of the claim that it is a sunna not to follow the actions of the Prophet [pbuh] may be due to the fact that he used to refrain from some mustahab actions for fear that they would become obligatory upon his community, that some may assume that they are obligatory or that a scholar or a person in authority might follow this action under the same assumption. Proponents of this claim thus maintained that it is a sunna not to follow the actions of the Prophet [pbuh] to block the means [forbidding or 'blocking' a lawful action because it could lead to an unlawful action] following some Maliki scholars and others. However, it is unacceptable to expand the scope of blocking the means since this was only possible before rulings became established. But afterwards, and after distinguishing between what is mustahab and what is obligatory, there is no room for either making such a claim or for acting upon it.This is especially so since it was reported that the Prophet [pbuh] used to specifically recite surat Al-Sajdah and Al-Insan on a continuous basis. It is invalid to allow 'blocking the means' and other similar statements to stand as a barrier between the people and between following the sunnah of the Prophet on a regular basis. Scholars maintain that following the sunnah of the Prophet [puh] takes precedence in all circumstances."

    "Question": "What is the ruling on supplicating audibly for the deceased by his grave after burial? This issue sparked a debate between those who carried a deceased to his grave.",
    "Answer": "It is sunna for those escorting the deceased to stand by his grave for some time after burial and supplicate for him. 'Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"After burying a person, the Prophet [pbuh] would stand at his grave and say, 'Seek forgiveness for your brother and pray that he be steadfast, for he is now being questioned\" [Reported by Abu Dawud and Hakim who declared it authentic].'Amr ibn al-`As said: \"When you bury me scatter earth over me and stand by my grave for the time it takes to slaughter a camel and divide its meat so that I may take comfort from your presence and think of how I will answer the messengers of my Lord [Munkar and Nakir]\" [Muslim]. And this takes place after the burial.There is no harm if supplications for the deceased are preceded with a brief sermon, reminding of death, softening hearts and bringing humility to the soul.Ali [may Allah honor him] said: \"We were attending a funeral, when the Prophet [pbuh] came and sat down and we sat around him. He held a stick with which he scratched the ground and said: \"There is none among you—not a soul—but has its place in paradise or hell assigned for him and it is determined for him whether he is among the blessed or the wretched.' A man said: 'Should we not depend on what was preordained?' The Prophet [pbuh] replied: 'Work hard, for every person was facilitated to do what he was created for\" [Reported by Bukhari and Muslim. Imam Bukhari dedicated a chapter to this issue which he entitled \"Exhortations and remaining by the graveside of the deceased\"].Imam Nawawi stated in Al-Adhkar: \"It is recommended to stand by the grave of the deceased for the time it takes to slaughter a camel and divide up its meat. Those attending should occupy themselves with reciting the Qur`an, supplicating for the deceased, preaching and telling stories of the pious. Imam al-Shaf'i and his students stated that it is recommended to recite some portions of the Qur'an by the grave of the deceased and it is better to complete it.Audible or silent?Allah left the manner of supplication for the deceased open. Therefore, if Allah legislates something, leaving it general while it can be executed in more than one manner, then it is not valid to restrict it in any way without the existence of evidence, since it would then be considered a reprehensible innovation. Consequently, it is impermissible to dispute over such matters.The Prohibition of delving into things on which Allah remained silentThe Prophet [pbuh] forbade persistent questions and debates and clarified that if Allah Almighty remains silent upon a certain matter, it is out of His mercy and generosity. The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Allah prescribed some duties so do not neglect them; prohibited certain things so do not violate them; set down certain limits so do not transgress them; He remained silent about some things, out of mercy for you and not out of forgetfulness, so do not delve into them\" [Reported by Darqatni and others through Abu Tha'laba al-Khushani may Allah be pleased with him].The scholar Taftazani wrote in his commentary on Imam Nawwai's 40 hadith: \"What is meant by 'do not delve into them' is not to ask about their rulings because asking about matters on which Allah remained silent leads to them becoming obligations which may be difficult to observe; so the general principle of permissibility of things stands.\"The Prophet [pbuh] illustrated the grave offence of those who caused restrictions upon Muslims due to their insistent questioning and delving into matters by saying: \"The gravest sinner amongst Muslims is the one who asks about something and probes into it, so it becomes prohibited due to his insistent questioning.\" [Reported by Muslim through Amir ibn Sa`d through his father may Allah be pleased with him].Abu Huraira [may Allah be pleased with him] said: \"The Prophet [pbuh] delivered a speech and said: \"O people! Perform Hajj for Allah has made it obligatory upon you.\" Hearing this, a man said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Should we perform it every year?\" The Prophet [pbuh] remained silent, but when the man repeated the question thrice, he said, \"If I say yes it will become obligatory upon you and you will be unable to do it.\" He continued, \"Do not ask me about matters on which I remain silent; the people who were before you were doomed for their constant questions to their Prophet”."

    "Question": "What is the ruling for the following takbir which is recited [before] both ‘Eid prayers:Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar. La ilaha illa Allah, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar wa lilahu al-hamd. Allahu akbar kabiran wa al-hamd lillahi kathiran wa subhan Allahu bukratan wa asilan. La ilaha illa Allah wahdu. Sadaqa wa'du wa nasara 'abdu wa `a'azza jundu wa hazama al-ahzab wahdu. La ilaha illa Allah wa la na'bud illa iya mukhlisin lahu al-din walaw kariha al-kafirun. Allahum salli 'ala sayiduna Mohammed wa 'ala al sayiduna Mohammed wa 'ala as-hab sayiduna Mohammed wa 'ala ansar sayiduna Mohammed wa 'ala azwaj sayiduna Mohammed wa 'ala dhuriyyat sayiduna Mohammed wa salam tasliman kathiran.",
    "Answer": "The takbir of the two ‘Eid is a recommended matter. Nothing specific concerning the phrasing of the takbir was mentioned in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). However some of the Companions – such as Salman al-Farisi – used to make the takbir saying:Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar. There is no god but Allah. Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, praise be to Allah.The order to do this is broad since the textual basis for this is unrestricted. God Most High says: “He wants you to complete the prescribed period] and to glorify Him for having guided you” (Quran 2:185).Unrestricted matters are left unrestricted until something in Islamic law comes to restrict them. Since long ago Egyptians, have used the following well-known phrasing of takbir:Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar. La ilaha illa Allah, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar wa lilahu al-hamd. Allahu akbar kabiran wa al-hamd lillahi kathiran wa subhan Allahu bukratan wa asilan. La ilaha illa Allah wahdu. Sadaqa wa'du wa nasara 'abdu wa `a'azza jundu wa hazama al-ahzab wahdu. La ilaha illa Allah wa la na'bud illa iya mukhlisin lahu al-din walaw kariha al-kafirun. Allahum salli 'ala sayiduna Mohammed wa 'ala al sayiduna Mohammed wa 'ala as-hab sayiduna Mohammed wa 'ala ansar sayiduna Mohammed wa 'ala azwaj sayiduna Mohammed wa 'ala dhuriyyat sayiduna Mohammed wa salam tasliman kathiran.TranslationAllahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar. There is no deity but God. Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, praise be to God. God is ever greatest, much praise be to God. Glory to Him morning and evening, there is no deity but God. He fulfilled His promise, gave victory to His slave, strengthened His army, and He alone vanquished the confederates. There is no deity but God, Him alone we worship, being sincere in our religion even though the unbelievers are averse. O, God, make Your prayers and blessings be upon our master Muhammad, upon the family of our master the Prophet , his companions, supporters, wives and upon the descendants of our master and praise him abundantly.It is a valid legal formulation and al-Imam al-Shafi‘i (may God grant him mercy) commented upon it saying: \"If one says Allahu Akbar as people do nowadays it is a good thing. If one adds more then it is also good. Any remembrance of God deem good.”It is permissible to add praise and blessings upon our master Muhammad and his family, companions, supporters, wives and his progeny at the end of the takbir. The best form is one that combines mention of God and His Prophet . Praising the Prophet opens the door of acceptance for our deeds; scholars have said that sending prayers upon the Prophet is always accepted – even from hypocrites – since it is related to his Excellency, our master the Prophet.Based on this, whoever claims that the person using this well-known phrasing is an innovator is the one closest to innovation since he has restricted what God and His Prophet left unrestricted without having any evidence to do so. We embrace what our good ancestors deemed good and what the people have accepted and become accustomed to when it agrees with our noble Islamic law. Their prohibition of such phrasings is incorrect, deserves no attention, and is undependable.And God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "It has become customary in governmental divisions to write the Basmallah (meaning, \"In the name of God Most Gracious, Most Merciful\") at the top of any request. These requests (and pages from newspapers containing Quranic verses and the Names of God) are later disposed of in trash cans or thrown on the street ,and thus get stepped on which undermines their sanctity. What is the ruling for this?",
    "Answer": "It has become common to write the names of God Almighty and Quranic verses on pieces of paper, plastic bags, containers, on governmental envelopes and requests, and so forth. This causes excessive difficulty for those who are legally responsible to observe the rulings of God2. This is because this responsibility demands that they dispose of these objects in a manner that befits the sanctity of God, His Book, and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) but which may include excessive hardship upon them due to lack of time or resolution. They have no other alternative but to desecrate the name of God, His Book, and the name of the Prophet (peace and blessing be upon him) under the pretext that the practice is common and it is difficult to dispose of these objects in any other manner.Consequently, the matter requires a common effort to eliminate this sin. Whenever possible, it is obligatory to avoid using any piece of paper or envelopes and so forth containing the Names of God, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and verses from the Quran. We call upon those who write the names of God and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) on anything, those who promote merchandise, and those in authority to draw up a system to collect such papers and dispose of them properly, either by burning or recycling them. We also call upon those who are financially capable to establish paper and plastic recycling projects. Finally, we call upon the public to exercise discretion as much as possible when disposing of paper and products containing the names of God, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and Quranic verses either by cutting them into small pieces or burning them. God Most High says:\"Anyone who honors the sacred ordinance of God will have good reward from his Lord\" (Quran 22:30).\"Those who honor God's rite show the piety of their hearts\" (Quran 22:32).God Most High knows best.Footnotes1. Something which is so well establishing in the religion that rejecting it is akin to rejecting the religion itself.2. Those who are adults, free, sane, and able."

    "Question": "What is the ruling for invoking blessings upon the Prophet after the adhan?",
    "Answer": "Invoking blessings upon the Prophet after the adhan is a sunnah Invoking blessings upon the Prophet after the adhan [call to prayer] is firmly established in the corpus of authentic hadiths. 'Abdullah Ibn 'Amr Ibn al-'As (may Allah be pleased with them both) narrated that he heard the Prophet say, \"When you hear the mu`adhin calling for prayer, repeat what he says and then invoke blessings upon me, because whoever does so will be earn a tenfold reward. Then beseech Allah to grant me al-Wasilah: it is a high rank in Paradise fit for only one of Allah's servants, and I hope to be that person. I will intercede for whoever asks that I attain al-Wasilah\" [Recorded by Muslim, Abu-Dawud, at-Tirmdhi and an-Nasa`i].The manner of invoking blessings upon the Prophet after the adhan There is no text that obligates a single manner, audible or silent, for invoking blessings upon the Prophet;the matter is open and capacious. When Allah Almighty legislates a matter in a general way and it may be executed and applied through various means, it must be left general and it is impermissible to restrict it to a certain manner without supporting proof.There are reports that evidence the [permissibility of] invoking blessings upon the Prophet audibly after the adhan. Abu al-Darda` (may Allah be pleased with him)narrated that after hearing the adhan, the Messenger of Allahwould say, \"Allahuma Rab hadhihi ad-da'wah at-tama was-salah al-qa`imah, salli 'ala Mohammed wa a'tih su`alihu yawm al-qiyamah [O Allah, Lord of this most perfect call and prayer that is now being established, send your blessings upon Muhammad and grant him his wish on the Day of Resurrection]\" [Recorded by At-Tabarani in Al-Mu'jam Al-Kabeer]. This was heard by those around him who would repeat themu`adhin'swords. The Prophet said, \"Whoever says this when he hears the mu`adhin, it becomes incumbent upon me to intercede for him on the Day of Judgment.\"The rulingThe matter is open and the right thing to do is to let people behave naturally. Whoever wants to send blessings upon the Prophet is free to make it in the manner and words which best appeal to him since it is important that the manner and formula resonate in his heart. It is impermissible for anyone to deny what others do as long as the matter is open and capacious.Allah Most High knows best."

    "Question": "Is invoking God (dhikr) in numbers more than those found in the sunna a reprehensible innovation (bid‘a) or impermissible (haram)?",
    "Answer": "Invoking God in abundance and in numbers more than those found in the sunna is an encouraged act. In reality it is an act that is commanded clearly in the book of God as He says, “O you who believe invoke God with much invocation.” And God has praised those who follow this command by saying, “save those who believe and do good works, and remember God often.” God also says, “Indeed in the messenger of God you have a good example for him who looks to God and the Last Day, and remembers God often.” , and “men who remember God often and women who remember - God has prepared for them forgiveness and a vast reward.” God has mentioned that those who invoke but a little have resembled the hypocrites, “and they [the hypocrites] do not invoke God except a little.” The Prophet said, “The unique ones have advanced” and the companions asked, “who are the unique ones O Messenger of God?” and he replied, “The men who invoke God often and the women.” He also said, “Do not seize your tongue from being moist with the remembrance of God.” , as well as:Whoever says “there is no deity but God alone is He, no partners does He have, to Him belongs the dominion, to Him belongs all praise, and He is over all things capable” one hundred times a day it is as if he freed ten slaves, and one hundred good deeds are written for him, and one hundred bad deeds are wiped away from his record…no one can bring better than this except someone who does it often.” All of these verses and hadiths emphasize that there is no limit to invoking (dhikr), and that the Shari‘ah has left the door to abundance in invoking open to any number. For someone to invoke God a number of times more than that found in the hadith literature is better than the one who has done less as is mentioned in the previously quoted hadith. Therefore invoking God is a recommended act and doing this abundantly is doing a recommended act abundantly. It is by invoking God that the hearts become alive, and by leaving it the hearts become dead.From what has been mentioned and based on the proof texts provided, it is permissible for a person to invoke God with any number he has chosen as a daily practice for himself, or has been given to him by a Sheikh who has insight. We ask God to enliven our hearts by invoking Him constantly and God is most high all knowledgeable."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6294/is-it-permissible-to-invoke-god-with-just-one-of-his-names-like-“allah-allah”",
    "Question": "What is the invocation (dhikr) of God? Is it permissible to invoke God with just one of His Names like “Allah, Allah” and, “al-Rahman, al-Rahman,” without it being in a full sentence?",
    "Answer": "Linguistically dhikr has the opposite meaning of forgetting, as is mentioned by the author of Mukhtar al-Sihah. In the terminology of the shari’ah, dhikr has a more general set of meanings. For example, God referred to the Friday khutbah as dhikr saying, O you who believe! When the call is heard for the prayer of the day of congregation, haste unto remembrance (dhikr) of God and leave your trading [62:9]; He referred to the hajj as dhikr saying, Remember (dhikr) God through the appointed days [2:203]; He referred to prayer as dhikr saying, And if you go in fear, then (pray) standing or on horseback. And if you are again in safety, remember (dhikr) God, as He has taught you that which (heretofore) you knew not [2:239]; and He referred to the Qur’an as dhikr saying, This (which) We recite unto you is a revelation and a wise reminder (dhikr) [3:58]. All of these acts of worship are referred to as dhikr since Muslims invoke the Name of God in them. As for the meaning of dhikr of God when not associated with any of these things, it is the invocation of God that Muslims do with their tongues and hearts outside of the acts of worship we have mentioned. God differentiates between invocation and prayer saying, Indeed, prayer preserves from lewdness and iniquity, but verily remembrance (dhikr) of God is greater [29:45]. The invocation of God may be done on one’s own or in a group, silently or out loud, it may be counted on one’s fingers or on prayer beads (as we made clear in the answers to the preceding questions), and it may be done with a phrase from the Qur’an and the hadith or not. It is permissible to compose a new invocation as long as it comprises meanings that do not conflict with Islam.There is nothing wrong with invoking one of God’s Names, and there is no evidence to indicate that it is forbidden, rather there is evidence that indicates its permissibility. Those who differ may object to the invocation of God through one of His Names for the following reasons: They may say, for example, that invoking God through one of His Names has not been related from the Prophet. This is something we clarified in an answer to a question which discusses the issue of the evidentiary nature of the Prophet’s not having done an action. We will return to an examination of a hadith that was mentioned in that fatwa in order to prove the permissibility of composing a new [form of] invocation, even if that invocation is [used] in the prayer.Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar mentions the hadith of Rifa’ah ibn Rafi’ al-Zarqi that says, “One day we were praying behind the Prophet and when he raised his head from bowing he said, “God hears those who praise.” A man behind him said, “O Lord, all praise is Yours, much good and blessed praise.” When he finished he asked, “Who was it that spoke?” The man replied, “It was I.” The Prophet said, “I saw thirty-odd angels hastening to be the first to write it down.” Following this he [Ibn Hajar] said, “This hadith has been used as evidence for the permissibility of composing a new invocation in prayer that is not from the Qur’an or the sunna as long as it does not contradict them.” The objection may also be that invoking God with one of His Names alone does not carry the meaning of exaltation, and one must have a complete sentence in order for that meaning to be present. The answer [to this objection] is that the invocation of God’s Name alone does carry the meaning of exaltation, and this is what the scholars understood. The Imam of imams, Abu Hanifah asserts this when discussing the issue of whether or not one enters prayer merely by mentioning the Name of God alone.The author of al-Bada’ says, “According to Abu Hanifah the text is understood [to mean that the opening of the prayer] has the meaning of exaltation, and that occurs with the Name alone. The evidence for this is that one would enter the prayer if he said, “There is no god but God,” and that occurs by his saying “God,” not by the negation.” So Imam Abu Hanifah is of the opinion that with the name God alone exaltation occurs without the condition of it being in a complete sentence.This is a response to those who differ if they claim that it is not found in the Qur’an and sunna, or that exaltation does not occur with it. In addition to these responses, there are texts in the Qur’an and the sunna that permit one to say, “Allah,” like that, on its own, and this covers the invocation of the Name of God. These texts include: Say: Allah. Then leave them to their play of caviling [6:91], and, So remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself with a complete devotion [73:8]. The prophetic hadiths evidence that the invocation of God with His Name alone will exist and be praised before the coming of the Hour and that its vanishing will be one of the final signs: according to Anas, the Prophet said, “The Hour will not come until ‘God, God,’ is no longer being said.” Another narration says, “The Hour will not come upon anyone saying, ‘God, God.” Thabit said, “Salman was in a group invoking God when the Prophet passed by, so they stopped. The Prophet said, “What were you saying?” We said, “We are invoking, ‘Allah, Allah.” He said, “I saw mercy descending upon you so I wanted to join you in it.” Then he said, “Praise to God who has placed in my community those with whom I have been commanded to be patient.” Muslims do not need evidence to say, “Allah” as long as they feel the meanings of exaltation, intimacy, and remembrance, as long as invoking the Name of God alone does not contradict the principles of faith and the bases of Islam, and as long as they assert that the invocations attributed to the Prophet are generally better. The transmitted and rational evidence we have mentioned, as well as the interpretation of the scholars, should make those who differ leave the invokers of God alone to invoke Him however their hearts are moved. And God is Most High and Knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6295/is-it-permissible-to-say-the-supplication-after-adhan-calling-to-prayer-out-lou",
    "Question": "Assalam ailkum wa rahmatullah wa baraktoh, I was praying in a Turkish mosque and found the meuzzin saying the duaa (supplication) after the azan out loud. Is this permissible?and after they finish the prayer they take a special moment for tasbeeh(praising God) and also the meuzzin says a few things. They say this according to the Hanafis but is there any proof for these acts?",
    "Answer": "The permissibility of making dhikr and du'aa` out loud is established by the Qur`an and sunna and the practice of the early and late generations of Muslims. A number of scholars authored books on this issue; these include al-Suyuti's treatise Natijat al-Fikr fi al-Jahr bil Dhikr and imam Abu al-Hasinat al-Laknawy's book Sahet al-Fikr fi al-Jahr bil Dhikr among others.Nothing has been mentioned in the source texts obligating the manner of invoking peace and blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), whether silently or audibly. The matter is capacious and when Allah legislates a matter in a general fashion and it can be done in more than one manner, it must be interpreted in light of its capaciousness. It is invalid to restrict it to a particular manner except in the existence of substantiating proof.Making du'a` and invoking greetings of peace upon the Prophet after the adhan (call to prayer) is an established sunna that was mentioned in authentic reports. Abdullah ibn Umar ibn al-'As (may Allah be pleased with them) related that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) say, \"When you hear the muezzin (caller to prayer) make the adhan, repeat what he says after him and then invoke peace and blessings upon me. For whosoever invokes peace and blessings upon me once, Allah sends blessings upon him ten-fold. Then ask Allah to grant me al-waseela — it is a rank in Paradise that is reserved for only one of the servants of Allah and I hope to that person. Whosoever asks Allah to grant me al-waseela will earn my intercession\" [Reported by Muslim, Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi, and an-Nisa`i].There are some reports from the Prophet that evince the practice of invoking peace and blessings upon him audibly after the adhan. Abu al-Darda` (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that upon hearing the adhan, the Messenger of Allah would say, \"O Allah! Lord of this comprehensive call and current prayer, grant Muhammad his request on the Day of Judgment.\" Those around him would hear him making this supplication, and he liked them to supplicate with the same after the adhan. He said, \"Whosoever supplicates with the same when he hears the mu`ezzin calling out the adhan, the intercession of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, becomes mandatory upon him on the Day of Judgment\"[Reported by at-Tabari in his Al-Mu'jam Al-Kabeer].The Divine injunctions in the Qur`an on making dhikr in general and after prayers in particular are general. These include: O ye who believe! Remember Allah, with much remembrance; and glorify Him morning and evening. [Qur`an 33: 41-42] And keep yourself content with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His face. [Qur`an 18: 28] When ye have performed the prayers, remember Allah, standing, sitting down, or lying down on your sides. [Qur`an 4: 103]A general injunction must be implemented as such until something comes to restrict it. Some ahadith indicate the permissibility of making dhikr audibly after prayers. Bukhari and Muslim reported that Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) narrated that during the Prophet's lifetime, voices would be raised in dhikr after the obligatory prayer. He said, \"I would know that prayers had finished when I would hear dhikr being made.\" In another wording of the hadith, he said, \"I would know that the Prophet had finished praying when I would hear the takbir (glorification of Allah).\" Those scholars who take the apparent meaning of the hadith, maintain the permissibility of making dhikr audibly after prayers while those who interpret it as the Prophet teaching the congregants to make dhikr, maintain that it is preferable to make dhikr after prayers silently; the permissibility of both audible or silent dhikr after prayers is acknowledged by both parties.Abu Hurayra (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, \"Allah the Almighty says, 'I am as my servant expects me to be. I am with him when he makes mention of Me; if he makes mention of Me to himself, I make mention of him to Myself. If he makes mention of Me in an assembly, I make mention of him in a better assembly. If he draws near to me a hand span, I draw near to him an arm's length and if he draws near to me an arm's length, I draw near to him a fathom's length. If he comes to me walking, I go to him at speed\" [Bukhari and Muslim].The luminary Ibn al-Jasriy wrote in Muftah al-Hisn al-Hasin, \"This hadith indicates the permissibility of making dhikr audibly, contrary to the opinion of those who forbid it.\" The hadith scholar al-Suyuti wrote in Natijat al-Fikr fil Jahr bil Dhikr, \"Mentioning someone in an assembly is always audible.\" Al-Suyuti mentioned in his treatise twenty five ahadith all of which point to the permissibility of making dhikr audibly. After mentioning the ahadith, he said, \"Upon contemplating the ahadith, one will note there is no aversion whatsoever to audible dhikr; rather, they indicate its recommendation either explicitly or implicitly. Their inconsistency with the hadith stating that the best kind of dhikr is that which is made silently, corresponds to the inconsistency between the ahadith on reading the Qur`an audibly and the ahadith on reading it silently, in comparison to the hadith on giving alms in secret. In reconciling between the ahadith, An-Nawawi mentions the virtues of both. He said that making dhikr silently is better for a person who fears hypocrisy or if his audible dhikr may harm others who are either praying or asleep. Otherwise, audible dhikr is better because it involves greater action, its benefit transcends to those who are listening, it stirs the heart of the invoker and energizes his determination to contemplate. Moreover, it drives away sleep and increases energy. Some people have said that it is recommended to recite the Qur`an audibly at some times and silently at others. This is because a person who recites the Qur`an silently may become bored and so resorts to reciting it audibly while a person who recites the Qur`an audibly may become fatigued and so resorts to reciting it silently.' End of quote. The same is applied to dhikr and in this manner we reconcile between the inconsistent ahadith.\"The best thing to say on this matter are the words of imam al-Tahawi in his meta-commentary Maraqi al-Faleh on the topic of reconciling ahadith and the opinions of scholars who differed on the preference of silent or audible dhikr and du'a`. He said: \"Matters differ due to the disparity between people, situations, time, and goals. When a person fears hypocrisy or when audible dhikr harms another, silent dhikr is better. Otherwise, it is preferable to make dhikr audibly.\" Muslims must not make this a cause of strife and dissonance. Objection is not for issues over which there is a difference of opinion. The right thing to do is to let people act spontaneously: whoever wishes may make dhikr audibly and whoever wishes may make dhikr silently.This is because the matter of dhikr and du'a` is capacious and the important thing is that a Muslim is to do what he finds in their heart. No one is entitled to object to another's practice as long as the matter is capacious."

    "Question": "Is making invocations (dhikr) out loud a reprehensible innovation?",
    "Answer": "Raising your voice to an intermediate level during glorification (tasbih) and the like is preferred (mustahab) by the majority of jurists. This is due to His saying, And be not loud-voiced in your worship nor yet silent therein, but follow a way between [17:110], which is what the Prophet used to do. According to Abu Qutadah the Prophet went out one night only to find Abu Bakr praying in a lowered voice. Then he passed by ‘Umar who was praying in a loud voice. When the two of them were present before the Prophet he said, “I passed by you, Abu Bakr, when you were praying in a lowered voice.” Abu Bakr replied, “I made myself heard to the One upon whom I called.” He said, “Raise your voice some.” Then he addressed ‘Umar saying, “I passed by you and you were praying in a loud voice.” ‘Umar replied, “O Messenger of God, I rouse the drowsy and drive out the Devil.” He said, “Lower your voice some.” Some of the pious ancestors were of the opinion that it is preferred to raise one’s voice when saying “Allahu Akbar” and the other invocations after the five daily prayers. They based this opinion on the hadith that was narrated according to Ibn Abbas in which he said, “It was by hearing [the invocations after the prayer] that I knew they had finished.” This also involves more actions and its benefit is more conducive to [producing] contemplation and waking the hearts of those who are not heedful. The best thing that was said about this matter is the statement of the author of Maraqi al-Falah in which he brings together the hadiths and the opinions of the scholars who differed as to which was better, lowering one’s voice during supplication and invocation or raising it. He said, “This differs depending on the person, the state [they are in], the time, and the purpose. Whenever one fears ostentation or bringing harm to someone else [by raising one’s voice], lowering one’s voice is better, and whenever these conditions are absent, raising one’s voice is better.”Accordingly, raising one’s voice during invocation is not a reprehensible innovation, and there is nothing wrong with it. In fact, it could be more effective in involving the heart and bringing about concentration, as long as the person is able to avoid ostentation. And God Most High knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling concerning prayer beads [subha]?",
    "Answer": "Invocation with prayer beads or any other device used to count is an act that is religiously sanctioned and confirmed by the Prophet [pbuh]. It is also an act that occurred among the Pious Predecessors [salaf] without any condemnation.Hadiths demonstrating permissibility- On the authority of Safiyya bint Hayy who said:The Messenger of Allah entered upon me one day and between my hands were four thousand date seed which I was using to invoke and I said, \"I have been using these to invoke.\"He replied, \"Shall I teach you something greater than this which you can use to invoke?\"\"Yes,\" I replied.He said, \"Say 'praise be to Allah the number of His creation\" [Reported by al-Tirmidhi. Graded rigorously authentic by al-Hakim and confirmed by al-Dhahabi].- On the authority of Sa'd ibn abu Waqqas, may Allah be pleased with him, who said:With the Prophet [pbuh] I visited a woman who had in her hands pebbles or date seeds which she was using to invoke. So the Prophet said, \"Shall I inform you of that which is easier and better than this? Say, 'praise be to Allah the number of His creation in the heavens, praise be to Allah the number of His creation on earth, praise be to Allah the number of His creation that He has created; Allah is the Greatest in the same amount, all thanks is due to Allah the same amount, there is no deity but Allah the same amount, and there is no power nor strength except by Allah the same amount\" [Reported by abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi. It has been graded authentic by al-Nisa`i and ibn Majah and graded rigorously authentic by ibn Habban and al-Hakim].- On the authority of al-Qasim ibn abd al-Rahman who said:Abu al-Darda` kept date seeds in a bag. When he would pray the Dawn Prayer he would take them out and invoke with them until they finished\" [Reported by Ahmed in al-Zuhd and graded rigorously authentic].- On the authority of abu Nadra al-Ghaffari who said:An old man from Tufawa informed me: \"Abu Hurayra settled in Madina and I have never seen anyone more diligent than him nor more honorable towards his guests. One day I was with him and he was on a bed with a bag of pebbles or date seeds which he was using to invoke. Below him was a black slave girl who would collect them once he would finish and return them to the bag\" [Reported by abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi and graded authentic by al-Nisa`i].- On the authority of Na'im ibn Muharar ibn Hurayra who narrated that his grandfather, abu Hurayra, said that he had a rope with one thousand knots and he never slept without invoking with it [Reported by Abdullah ibn al-Imam Ahmed in al-Zawa`id al-Zuhd and by abu Na'im in his Hilyat al-Awliya].The same has been narrated by our master Sa'id al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, abu Safyya, the Prophet's servant, Fatima, the daughter of al-Hussayn who is the son of Ali ibn abu Talib and others from among the companions and their successors.Many scholars have composed works demonstrating that the use of prayer beads is religiously sanctioned.

    "Question": "What is the ruling for invoking using litanies (hizbs) and daily regimens of invocation (wirds) that have been compiled, and what is the ruling for a Muslim selecting a set invocation to invoke with daily?",
    "Answer": "Daily regimens of invocation and litanies are collections of various sunna invocations or others which a person commits to invoking periodically as a way to draw nearer to God. This is a voluntary act that a Muslim volunteers to engage in and is not something that God has prescribed on one. Sheikh Zakariyyah al-Ansari has stated that “voluntary acts are those acts which have no corresponding specific textual evidence; rather a person initiates it themselves by choosing a daily invocation.” Ibn Hajar al-Haytami has stated that: [a] person being vigilant in keeping a daily regimen whether it be prayer, a portion of the Qur’an, certain invocations, supplication during the day and night and otherwise is a sunna of the Messenger of God and the pious from amongst God’s servants of the past and present. That which has been sanctioned by the sunna in groups should be done and that which has been sanctioned by the sunna individually should be done just as the companions sometimes would gather and one would be asked to read and the others would listen. Umar ibn al-Khattab used to say, “O Abu Musa, remind us of God” and he would recite [from the Qur’an] and the rest would listen. The scholars used to discuss regimens of invocation and litanies as if it were an issue that was agreed upon. They would mention it in passing without pointing out its ruling or any scholarly dispute concerning it. An example of this is the statement of Ibn Najim who said, “al-Halwani mentioned that there is nothing wrong with one reciting daily regimens of invocation between canonical and supererogatory prayers.” The scholars have indicated the benefit in one committing to these daily regimens and the necessity of keeping this commitment. Imam al-Nawawi has stated: Anyone who misses a daily regimen of invocation to which they have committed themselves whether it be during the night or day, after prayer, or during any condition should make it up and should be vigilant in saying it. If one has made it a habit they should not let it pass; if one is lax in making it up, then one will become lax in reciting it during its proper time.Al-Shawkani used to say that that the companions of the Messenger of God would make up that which they missed from their daily regimens of invocation. Ibn ‘Allan said [regarding conditional versus non-conditional invocations] “what is meant from conditions are conditions related to certain timings, not related to certain causes as with invocations made when seeing the new crescent moon, upon hearing thunder, and the like. These do not have to be made up when their causes pass. It is reprehensible to leave a daily regimen of invocation after making it a habit.” Ibn al-Hajj has written:An aspirant must be vigilant and accurate in his times. Every moment should be filled with an action that is related to a specific regimen. Regimens should not be resigned to prayer and fasting, rather all the actions of an aspirant are a type of regimen. The pious ancestors used to respond to one who wanted to meet another who was sleeping, “he is engaged in his daily regimen of sleep.” Sleep, therefore, and other actions similar are daily regimens an aspirant uses to draw nearer to his Lord. If this is so, then one’s time of sleep is known as is the time of his nightly invocation is known, as is the time when he meets with his friends is known, as is the time he spends with his family and close relatives is known. All of these are daily regimens as all an aspirant’s time is spent drenched in obedience to his Lord. He does not engage in anything from that which is permissible to engage in or recommended except with the intention of drawing nearer to God. This is the reality of regimens, i.e. drawing nearer to God, which come from either being engaged in serious struggle to rid one’s health and soundness from barriers and oppositions, or this is attained from a spiritual state that comes to one which serves as a cause for leaving these actions. Considering the above, we find that being committed to litanies and daily regimens of invocation is the only means that aids the Muslim in being constant in invoking God. This is the action of the pious ancestors and is therefore a recommended act as means take the rulings of their desired goals and God is most high most knowledgeable."

    "Question": "What is the ruling of gathering in circles to make invocations (dhikr)?",
    "Answer": "Gathering to make invocations in circles is a sunna that is established by evidences in the shari’ah. God ordained it in the Qur’an saying, Restrain yourself along with those who cry unto their Lord at morning and evening, seeking His Countenance [18:28], and the Prophet said, “God Most High has angels that travel the roads seeking out those who make invocations. When they find a group of people invoking God they call out to each other, “Come to that which you seek!” and they encircle them with their wings up to the sky…And God says [to the angels], “You are My witnesses, I have forgiven them.” The angels say, “So and so is not one of them, he only came for a personal need.” To which God replies, “The one who sits with them does not suffer.” According to Mu’awiyah, the Prophet encountered a gathering of his companions and asked them, “What has brought you together here?” They replied, “We have gathered to invoke and praise [God] for guiding us to Islam and blessing us.”…He said, “Jibril came and told me that God is boasting to the angels about you.” In his book Riyad al-Salihin al-Nawawi placed the first hadith under the chapter heading, “Circles of Invocation.” Invocation has many meanings in the terminology of the shari’ah. These meanings include: the mere mentioning of God’s Essence, Attributes, Actions, or Rulings; the recitation of the Qur’an; supplicating and beseeching Him; and praising Him through His sanctity, exaltation, unity, praise, thanks, and glorification. There is no evidence to support those who claim that the sessions of religious study are what are intended here by circles of invocation.Al-San’ani mentions the hadith narrated by Muslim on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that says, “The Messenger of God said, ‘No group of people gathers to invoke God except that angels surround them, mercy descends upon them, and God mentions them to those in His presence.” Then he [al-San’ani] says: This hadith indicates the virtues of gathering for the purpose of invocation. Al-Bukhari narrates that, “Angels travel the roads seeking out those who make invocations. When they find a group of people invoking God they call out to each other, ‘Come to that which you seek!’ and they encircle them with their wings up to the sky…” So one of the virtues of gatherings for the purpose of invocation is that the angels are in attendance after having sought them out. That which is meant by invocation is the glorification and praise [of God], the recitation of the Qur’an, and similar acts of worship.In the hadith narrated by al-Bazzar God Most High asks the angels, “What are my servants doing?” even though he knows better than they, and they reply, “They glorify Your divinity, recite Your Book, pray for Your prophet, and ask of you concerning their worldly lives and their afterlives.” The literal meaning of invocation is the invocation of the tongue, and whoever pronounces it is rewarded. Being conscious of the meaning [of the invocation] is not a condition, rather it is a condition not to intend other than God. Adding the invocation of the heart to the invocation of the tongue is more complete, adding to that a consciousness of the meaning of the invocation along with what it comprises of glorification of God and negating all shortcomings on His behalf is even more complete, if this occurs during a mandatory act of righteousness, like prayer, jihad, and the like, it is even more complete, and if it is done sincerely for God, it is the most complete. Let it be known based on that which has preceded that gathering together to invoke God by reciting the Qur’an, studying religious knowledge, or pronouncing God’s Glorification [by saying subhan Allah], His Oneness [by saying la ilaha illa Allah], and His Praise [by saying al-hamdu lillah] is one of the sunnas that our Lord encouraged us to perform in the Qur’an, and it is the correct and incontrovertible sunna of His Prophet And God is Most High and Knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6312/what-is-the-ruling-on-using-prayer-beads-subha",
    "Question": "What is the ruling on using prayer beads (subha)?",
    "Answer": "Prayer beads are beads attached on a string used to invoke one’s normal invocation on. It is a new word introduced into Islamic discourse, and it is a means to righteous actions. Therefore, since means take the ruling of their desired goals, the prayer bead is a recommended act as it aids in one invoking God. The prayer bead is a permissible tool for a Muslim to use instead of counting on one’s fingers or digits during one’s regimen (wird). It is better than counting on one’s fingers and digits if one is safer from making mistakes this way allowing the heart to concentrate. The proof text for its permissibility is the hadith narrated on the authority of S‘ad ibn Abi Waqqas who entered with the Prophet upon a women who had in her hands pebbles or date seeds which she was using to invoke, and the Messenger of God said,Shall I inform you of that which is easier and better than this? Say “praise be to God the number of His creation in the heavens, praise be to God the number of His creation in the earth, praise be to God the number of His creation between the two, praise be to God the number of His creation that He has created, God is the greatest the same amount, all praise is due to God the same amount, there is no deity but God the same amount, and there is no power nor strength except by God the same amount.” The Prophet did not prohibit her from her action; rather he guided her to that which was easier and better for her to do. If there were something reprehensible or detestable in her actions he would have pointed this out.The jurists have understood this text to be one indicating the permissibility of invoking with either the hands or with prayer beads outside of the prayer similar to counting with one’s heart or finger tips. During prayer, however, it is considered a reprehensible act as it is not from the actions of the prayer. Abu Yusuf and Muhammad, from the Hanafi School, ruled that there was nothing wrong with using prayer beads after canonical or supererogatory prayers. There are many hadith concerning this issue such as:1. On the authority of al-Qasim ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman who said, “Abu Darda’ used to have ajwa date seeds in a bag. When he would pray the dawn prayer he would take them out and invoke with them until they finished.” 2. On the authority of Abu Nadra al-Ghaffari who said, “An old man from Tufawah informed me, ‘Abu Hurayyrah settled in Madina and I have never seen anyone more diligent than him, and I have never seen anyone more honorable towards their guests than him. One day I was with him and he was on a mat with a bag of pebbles or date seeds which he was using to invoke. Below him was a black slave girl who would collect them once he would finish and return them to the bag.’” 3. On the authority of Na‘im ibn Muharar ibn Abi Hurayyrah, on the authority of his Grandfather Abu Hurayyrah that he [Abu Hurayyrah] had a rope with one thousand knots and he never slept without invoking with it. This hadith has been narrated by Abdullah the son of Imam Ahmad in Zawaid al-Zuhd and by Abu Na‘im in his Hilyat al-Awliya. The same has been narrated by S‘ad ibn Abu Waqqas, Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri, Abu Safyyah the client of the Prophet, and lady Fatima the daughter of al-Hussayn who is the son of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib.Many scholars have composed works demonstrating that the use of prayer beads is religiously sanctioned. Among the well known works are the treatises by Imam Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti “al-Munha fi al-Subha”, Sheikh Muhammad ibn ‘Allan al-Sidiqi’s “Iyqad al-Masabih Limashru‘iyat Itikadh al-Masabih”, and Abu Hasan al-Laknawi’s treatise “Nuzhat al-Fikr fi Subhat al-Dhikr”. We will also quote the relied upon jurists from the various schools of law to further clarify this issue. 1. From the Shafi‘i School Ibn Hajar al-Haythami was asked “do prayer beads have a source from the sunna?” and he replied accordingly:Yes, and many scholars have composed works concerning this matter such as Imam al-Suyuti. From the sunna we have the following hadith from Ibn ‘Umar who said, “I saw the Prophet invoking with his hands.” And the hadith from Safiyyah who said, the Messenger of God came in upon me and in my hands were four thousand date seeds I was using to invoke and he said to me “What is this daughter of Hay?” and I said, “I invoke with them.” And he said, “I have invoked more than this since the moment I saw you.” and I said, “teach me Messenger of God.” and he said, “say ‘praise be to God the number of His creation.’” Ibn Abi Shaybah, Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi have narrated the following text: “Praise God, proclaim His Oneness and sanctifying Him, and do not be forgetful so that you would forget monotheism. Count by your finger tips as they are held accountable and will testify [on the day of judgment].” Invoking with stones, seeds, and tied ropes has also been documented by many from the companions and those after them. Al- Daylami has narrated with a raised chain (marfu‘ ) “how great a device for invoking the prayer bead is.” Some of the scholars have opined that invoking with the fingertips is better than a prayer bead based on the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar, while others have preferred the prayer bead, while still others have detailed the issue by saying if one is safe from making mistakes then the fingertips are better and if not then the prayer bead is better. 2. From the Hanafi School Ibn Abidin has stated:“there is nothing wrong with using a prayer bead” which is a device used for invoking…the proof of its permissibility is the hadith narrated by Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, Nisai, Ibn Hibban, and Hakim (who said it is rigorously authentic) on the authority of S‘ad ibn Abi Waqqas [quoted above]. The Messenger of God did not forbid her from this act; rather he guided her to that which was easier and better. If this act were reprehensible he would have indicated this. The prayer bead does not add anything to this hadith except connecting the stones by a thread. This sort of addition does not add anything to prevent the act. There is also nothing wrong in that it has been related that many of the elect of the Sufis used to have prayer beads as well as others. By God, however, if there is ostentation in using prayer beads we have nothing to say. The aforementioned hadith also attests to the preferred status of the specific mentioned invocation over other invocations that are freely composed even if this specific invocation is recited but a little. 3. Al-Shawkani has also written brilliantly:The two previously mentioned hadith [quoted above] indicate the permissibility of counting invocation with date seeds and stones; likewise prayer beads, as there is no difference in the Prophet’s affirming the two women’s actions. His lack of disavowing their action and advising them to that which was better does not negate the permissibility of the act. This same meaning has been found in hadith narrated in the Juz’of Hilal al-Haffar on the authority of Mutamir ibn Sulayman on the authority of Abi Safiyyah the client of the Prophet that a leather mat would be placed for him and a basket made of palm leaves filled with stones would be brought to him from which he would invoke until midday when he would get up. After [the noon] prayer he would return to it [and invoke] until the late afternoon. This hadith was also narrated by Ahmad in his book al-Zuhd on the authority of ‘Affan, on the authority of Abd al-Wahid ibn Ziyad, on the authority of Yunus ibn ‘Abid, on the authority of his mother who said, “I saw Abu Safiyyah, a companion of the Prophet and he was a treasurer….he used to invoke with stones.”Ibn S‘ad also narrated on the authority of Hakim ibn al-Daylam that S‘ad ibn Abi Waqqas used to invoke with stones. Ibn S‘ad also says in his Tabaqat that, “we were told by ‘Abdallah ibn Musa, on the authority of Isra’il, on the authority of Jabir, on the authority of a women who used to serve him, on the authority of Fatima the daughter of al-Husayn the son of Ali ibn Abi Talib that she used to invoke with a rope that was tied [in several] knots. Abdallah the son of Imam Ahmad narrated in Zawaid al-Zuhd on the authority of Abu Hurayrrah that he used to have a rope that had one thousand knots and he would not sleep until he finished [invoking on them all].Imam Ahmad in his book al-Zuhd narrated on the authority of al-Qasim ibn Abd al-Rahman who said, “Abu Darda’ used to have ajwa date seeds in a bag, and he would invoke with them after praying the dawn prayer one by one until they finished. Ibn S‘ad also narrates on the authority of Abu Hurayyrah that he used to invoke with date seeds grouped together. Al-Daylami narrates from the musnad of al-Firdous from the chain of Zaynab bint Sulayman ibn ‘Ali, on the authority of Um al-Hazan bint Jafar, on the authority of her father, on the authority of her grandfather, on the authority of ‘Ali with a raised chain (marfuan) who said, “how great a device for invoking the prayer bead is.” Imam al-Suyuti has compiled these traditions in a treaties entitled al-Munha fi al-Subha which is a portion of a larger work al-Majmu fi al- Fatawi. [Imam al-Suyuti] has stated in the end of this treatise “no one from the pious ancestors or the later scholars has been documented as prohibiting counting invocation using prayer beads. Rather most of them used to commonly use prayer beads and they found nothing reprehensible in this.” From this previous discussion we can see that invocation on prayer beads is a recommended act, and it is better for a person if they feel they will make a mistake in counting on their own. This way one’s heart will be involved and collected during invoking and God is most high and most knowledgeable."

    "Answer": "Lady 'A`isha (may God be pleased with her) said, \"We went out with the Messenger of God (from al-Medina) with the intention of performing hajj only\" (Bukhari and Muslim). This hadith and others prove that it is permissible for a woman to accompany her husband on hajj. This permissibility is also based on the consensus of scholars who have unanimously agreed that hajj is obligatory for a woman who is capable of undertaking it.Scholars have differed whether the company of a mahram (unmarriageable kin) is among the conditions of capability. According to the dominant opinion, it is permissible for a woman to go for hajj without a mahram but with trustworthy company.The opinion appropriate for fatwa at present is that this is permissible and there is no objection to a woman traveling alone by the various safe routes and means of travel via their venues such as airports, harbors, and the like. This applies whether she is traveling for something obligatory, recommended, or permissible. The hadiths forbidding a woman to travel without a mahram pertain to lack of security which was previously the case. Based on this, if a woman's safety is ensured, the prohibition does not apply in the first place.Scholars have unanimously agreed that a husband is entitled to prevent his wife from going for a voluntary hajj although he is not entitled to"

    "Question": "Can I Perform hajj on behalf of someone else?",
    "Answer": "- Abdullah Ibn 'Abbas (may God be pleased with them both) narrated, \"Al-Fadl Ibn 'Abbas was riding behind the Messenger of God and a woman from the tribe of Khath'am approached the Messenger with a question. Al-Fadl and the woman kept looking at each other so the Messenger of God turned al-Fadl's face to the other side. The woman said, ‘O Messenger of God! My father is an old man. He cannot sit firmly on his mount and therefore cannot perform his obligatory hajj. May I perform hajj on his behalf?' The Prophet replied, ‘Yes, you may.’ This was during the Farewell Pilgrimage.”1- Abdullah Ibn 'Abbas (may God be pleased with them both) narrated, \"The Messenger of God heard a man say, ‘O God! Here I am in response to your call on behalf of Shubrumah.’ The Prophet asked, ‘Who is Shubrumah?’ The man replied, ‘A brother or close relative. The Prophet asked, ‘Have you made your own hajj?’ ‘No,’ he replied. The Prophet said, ‘Perform your own hajj first and then perform it on behalf of Shubrumah.\"2From the above two hadiths, it is evident that it is permissible for a person to perform hajj on behalf of another either voluntarily or for a fee provided he has performed his own obligatory hajj. It is likewise a condition that the person on whose behalf hajj will be performed is unable to perform it himself i.e. is deceased, suffers a broken body part, has a physical disability, a chronic disease, or is incarcerated with no hope of release. In one report from Hanafi scholars, the ruling is the same for a blind person. It is impermissible to perform hajj on behalf of a person who has a recoverable disease.-----------------------------------------------------1 Recorded by Bukhari (1538) and Muslim (3315).2 Recorded by Abu Dawud (1813), Ibn Majah (3015) and Ibn Haban (3988).

The legal meaning of the word is to span the distance between the mountains of al-Safa and al-Marwa seven times back and forth after having performed tawaf for either hajj or 'umra.Scholarly opinions on the ruling of sa'yThe majority from among the Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali scholars have maintained that sa'y is one of the obligatory actions of hajj and 'umra without which they are incomplete. Hanafi scholars have maintained that sa'y is required and not obligatory i.e. a pilgrim who neglects it is obliged to slaughter in expiation and his hajj is complete. Imam Ahmed, in one report, considered sa'y a sunna, the omission of which does not obligate slaughtering in expiation. This same opinion was likewise reported from some of the salaf. However, scholars are unanimous that sa'y is one of the legal requirements.The mountains of al-Safa and al-MarwaThe rite of sa'y is contingent upon the mountains of al-Safa and al-Marwa, as is evident from the words of Allah Almighty, Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of Allah. So if those who visit the House in the Season or at other times, should compass them round, it is no sin in them. And if any one obeys his own impulse to good, be sure that Allah is He Who recognizes and knows. [Qur`an 2:158]Similarly, when he addressed the pilgrims who had assumed ihram for hajj, the Prophet said, \"Release yourselves from ihram after performing tawaf at the Holy House and making sa'y between al-Safa and al-Marwa.\"1 These two known mountains facing each other are located at Mecca; the first lies at the foot of Abu Qubays Mountain and the latter lies at the foot of Qu'aqi'an Mountain. In the past, people built houses and stores on the western and eastern sides and the northern and southern borders of the mas'a that led to its narrowing. In 1357 AH, the Saudi authorities removed these buildings after compensating their owners so that the mas'a would only be designated for worship and accommodate all Muslims wishing to perform hajj and 'umra. Since the number of pilgrims has greatly increased, Saudi authorities decided to expand the width of the mas'a to facilitate the rite for pilgrims and guarantee their safety.Validity of making sa'y in the new mas'aIn our opinion, it is valid to perform sa'y in the new mas'a and this fulfills the obligation, Allah the Almighty says, Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of Allah. So if those who visit the House in the Season or at other times should compass them round, it is no sin in them. And if any one obeyeth his own impulse to good, be sure that Allah is He Who recognize and know. [Qur`an 2:158]In this holy verse, Allah Almighty commands pilgrims to make sa'y between al-Safa and al-Marwa. It is only logical that the entire area between them be a place where the rite may be performed. This is because the verse did not specify a certain area or exclude another. The new mas'a lies between the two mountains. Here, it is worthy to point out some important matters that prove the validity of the new mas'a and of performing sa'y in it: It important to keep in mind what exactly is designated by al-Safa and al-Marwa in the Arabic language. And since the Shari'a addresses us in the Arabic language, then the principle is to construe the lexical meanings unless the Shari'a attaches a specific meaning to them, thereby taking precedence over the lexical meanings. However, no specific Shari'a meanings are relevant to the issue under discussion. The Prophet started his sa'y from a certain place in al-Safa and proceeded to al-Marwa until he reached a certain place there. It is difficult for us today to trace his path since these spots are unknown to us. He then repeated the rounds until he completed seven. It is possible that the Prophet started and ended each round from the same exact same spots as it is likewise possible that he deviated slightly from them. Nevertheless, nothing was reported either from him or from any of his Companions that specified a certain locus between al-Safa and al-Marwa in which sa'y is to be made nor did they eliminate another. This proves that its specification and restriction are not a legal intent. Sheikh Abd al-Rahman Ibn Yahya al-Mu'alami al-Yamani (died in 1386 AH, may Allah have mercy on him) wrote in his treatise on the expansion of the mas'a: \"Since nothing was reported from the Prophet or his Companions demarcating the width of the mas'a, this demonstrates that this is not a legal intent. Otherwise, it would have been a greater priority—because of the buildings which have been erected there—to specify its width than to specify 'Arafat, Muzdalifa and Mina whose boundaries were determined in reports.\" For this reason, the books on Jurisprudence did not tackle the issue of determining the width of the mas'a; rather, they only discussed the obligation of spanning the distance between al-Safa and al-Marwa as one of the requirements of sa'y. Some mentioned the linear distance between the two mountains which equals 777 arm spans without discussing its width. This indicates that the ruling for traversing between the two mountains revolves around traversing the linear distance regardless of its width. The ruling for specifying the width of the two mountains depends on the lexical meaning of al-Safa and al-Marwa and there is nothing in the Shari'a to contravene their lexical meanings. Imam Shams al-Din al-Ramli was asked in his Fatawa: \"Has the width of the mas'a been demarcated?\" He replied, \"I have not come upon anyone who has done so; their [scholars'] reticence is only because there is no need to specify its width.The obligation is for a pilgrim to span the entire distance between the two mountains and place his heels against the wall of al-Safa [when he turns from it and heads in the other direction] and the tip of his toes against the wall of al-Marwa [when he reaches it] and vice-versa. He must do this in each round. Similarly, a mounted person is to put the hoofs of the animal against the wall of each mountain.\"2 Al-Ramli wrote in Nihayat Al-Muhtaj: \"There is nothing in their [scholars'] statements about the width of the mas'a as there was no need to specify it. What is important and obligatory is that [a pilgrim making] sa'y span the entire distance between the two mountains in every round. There is no harm if he deviates slightly as mentioned by Al-Shafi'i (may Allah be pleased with him).3 Some historians have mentioned that the width of the mas'a is 35 arm spans. This is not considered a legal demarcation that renders any expansion impermissible. Rather, it was a description of what they witnessed since neither the Prophet nor Muslims have specified its width. Therefore, what is obligatory with regards to the sa'y is simply to span the distance between al-Safa and al-Marwa as they were before any changes, demolitions or new constructions on or between them."

    "Question": "What is the extent of the legitimacy of determining the day of 'Arafat and the day of 'Eid ul-Adha by sighting the crescent in our country? Or is it obligatory to follow Saudi Arabia in this matter?",
    "Answer": "Allah the Exalted prescribed acts of worship, whether obligatory or optional, some of which are time restricted.Allah the Almighty said:For such prayers are enjoined on believers at stated times.[An-Nisaa`: 103] Ramadhan is the (month) in which was sent down the Qur'an, as a guide to mankind, also clear (Signs) for guidance and judgment (Between right and wrong). So every one of you who is present (at his home) during that month should spend it in fasting. [Al-Baqarah: 185]They ask thee concerning the New Moons. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of time in (the affairs of) men, and for Pilgrimage. [Al-Baqarah: 189]Standing on 'Arafat is the most important pillar of hajj. The Prophet said, \"Hajj is 'Arafat.\"He further explained that 'Eid ul-Adha follows standing at 'Arafat. The Prophet instructed us that the Day of 'Arafat, which is the 9th of Dhul-Hijja, and the Day of Adha are only determined by sighting the moon at the beginning of the month. 'Arafat is a mountain in Mecca which the pilgrims stand on. Therefore, the reference for determining the days of 'Arafat and 'Eid, is sighting the moon in Mecca [Umm al-Qura].The rulingBased on the above, it is impermissible for any of the Islamic countries to determine the day of 'Arafat and the day of 'Eid according to their local crescent sighting that is inconsistent with the sighting of Saudi Arabia. This will lead to variant sightings and perplex the pilgrims of Allah's Sacred House.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Some people complete a reading of the entire Qur`an three days after a person's death. What is the ruling for this, and does the reward for it reach the deceased?",
    "Answer": "Reading the Qur'an is unrestricted in Islamic law Reading the noble Qur'an is one of the best acts of worship that a Muslim practices to draw closer to his Lord. In Islamic law, the command to read the Qur'an occurs in an absolute sense; it is established in the principles of jurisprudence that unrestricted matters entail all places, times and conditions except what has been omitted or restricted by Islamic law. Reading the Qur'an over a deceased According to the consensus of scholars, it is permissible to read the Qur'an to a deceased at the time of his death or after; at his home, in the mosque, at his grave side or any other place and at time of burial or after. Some Maliki scholars maintained that it is specifically disliked to read the Qur'an at the graveside. However, Sheikh al-Dardir, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The later scholars from the Malikis maintained that there is no harm in reciting the Qur'an, making remembrance of Allah and dedicating the reward to a deceased; the reward for these acts reaches him by the will of Allah.\" Scholarly authorship• Al-Qira`a 'ala al-Qubur by the Hanbali scholar al-Khalal; • The Hanbali luminary Shams al-Deen al-Maqdisi wrote a treatise on this subject;• Tawdeeh al-Bayan li Wusul Thawab al-Qur`an by 'Abdullah al-Ghamri; and others.Evidence from the Sunnah on the Permissibility of Reading the Qur'an for the Deceased • Ma'qal ibn Yassar, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Read Ya Seen over your dead\" [Reported by Ahmed, Abu Dawud and ibn Majah. Ibn Hiban and al-Hakim declared it authentic]. The hadith demonstrates the permissibility of reciting Ya Seen both at the time of death and after. • Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, narrated that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him and his family) say: \"When any of you dies, do not delay [his burial] but hasten to take him to his grave. Afterwards, read al-Fatiha at his head and the closing verses of Surat al-Baqarah at his feet\" [Reported by al-Tabarani and al-Baihaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman. Ibn Hajar declared it fair]. Another phrasing of the hadith mentions 'the opening verses of Surat al-Baqarah instead of the Fatiha. • Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, instructed that the opening and closing verses of Surat al-Baqarah be read at his graveside when he is buried [Reported by al-Khalal. Ibn Qudamamh declared it authentic and al-Mawawi declared it fair]. It was mentioned in another narration that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his family) said \"read the opening verses of Surat al-Baqarah (i.e. first five verse)\" instead of al-Fatiha.\" • Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet [pbuh] said, \"Whoever enters a cemetery and recites (Ya Seen), Allah will mitigate the punishment of the grave dwellers, and he will receive a reward equal to the number of deceased therein\" [Reported by 'Abdul 'Aziz the student of al-Khalal. Ibn Qudama mentions it in al-Mughni]. Scholarly opinionsThe stronger opinion concerning this matter is the permissibility of reciting the Qur`an for the deceased and some scholars even maintain that there is a scholarly consensus on this matter; these include: • The Hanbali scholar, ibn Qudama al-Maqdisi who said: \"Any act of worship the reward of which is dedicated to a deceased Muslim will benefit him by the will of Allah … some scholars contend that if the Qur'an is read at the side of the deceased or its reward is dedicated to him, the reader receives the reward and the deceased will gain the mercy of its recitation … The opinion of our school which we have previously mentioned, is the unanimity of Muslims [on the permissibility of donating the reward of Qur`anic recitations to the deceased]; Muslims in every place and age have gathered to recite the Qur`an and dedicated its reward to their dead without any criticism\" [Al-Mughni, 2/225]. • Sheikh al-'Uthmani cited the unanimous scholarly agreement in his book Rahmat al-Ummah fi Ikhtilaf al-A'immah, and said: \"Scholars unanimously agreed that asking forgiveness for the deceased, supplicating for him, and the reward of giving out in charity, performing Hajj andmanumitting [slaves] on his behalf reaches and benefits him and that it is recommended to recite the Qur'an at the grave.\" Scholars deduced the permissibility of reciting the Qur`an for the deceased from that of making Hajj on his behalf and the fact that its reward reaches him. This is because Hajj includes prayers which, in turn includes the Fatiha and other Qur`anic chapters."

    "Question": "Don’t we have to say after reading Qur'an (sadaqa Allahu al-azeim)...is this true? Please clarify",
    "Answer": "It is recommended in Islamic law to say \"Sadaqqa Allahu Al-Adhim\" or (God has told the truth) after finishing a Qur'anic recitation. This is based on the words of God Almighty, \"Say [O Muhammad] 'God has told the truth'\". (Qur'an 3: 95)In this verse, God Almighty legislates an unrestricted command. It is established in the science of Islamic legal theory [usul al-Fiqh] that an unrestricted command encompasses all times, places, people and conditions. There is nothing wrong if this verse was revealed in response to the Jews, regarding what they falsely attributed to the Torah. This is because it is likewise established that the important thing is the general purport of the words and not their contextual specificity.Muslims, past and present, have abided by the practice of saying \"Sadaqqa Allahu Al-Adhim\" after ending a Qur'anic recitation and no one criticized it at any time. Rather, scholars deemed it from among the etiquettes of Qur'anic recitation. In his Qur'an exegesis (vol.1. p.27), Imam al-Qurtubi said, \"[The erudite, al-Tirmidhi, mentioned that saying \"Sadaqqa Allahu Al-'Adhim\" is from among the etiquettes of Qur'anic recitation. He said, \"Part of the sanctity ascribed to the Qur`an is to testify, after finishing the recitation, to the truth of the words of God and to bear witness that His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) has conveyed His message by saying: 'God the Greatest has spoken the truth and His noble Messenger has conveyed it. A Muslim is to confirm this by saying: 'O Lord, You have spoken the truth and we bear witness that You have conveyed the message to Your messengers. O Lord, make us among the truthful witnesses and followers of justice.' And then he is to supplicate God for whatever he wishes.\"]In his book Al-Ihyaa' (vol. 1, p.278), Imam al-Ghazali enumerated the etiquettes of reciting the Qur'an and said, \"The 8th etiquette: start reciting the Qur`an by saying \"I seek refuge in God the All-Hearing, the All Knowing from the accursed Satan. My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the incitements of the devils, and I seek refuge in You, my Lord , lest they be present with me.' Then he is to recite the chapters of Al-Nas and Al-Fatiha. After finishing his recitation, the reader is to say: 'God Almighty has spoken the truth and His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) has conveyed His message. O Lord grant us the benefit of the Qur'an and bless it. All praise is due to God, Lord of the worlds and I ask Him, the Ever living, the Self existing, for forgiveness.\"]Saying \"Sadaqqa Allahu Al-Adhim\" is a virtuous Sunnah that the predecessors and successors from among the Muslims have abided by for generations without any repudiation. In fact, denying the validity of this practice is considered a Bid'a [innovation in religion] because those who object to it deny the permissibility of uttering it after reciting the Qur`an although it is permissible to utter it at any time. Therefore, prohibiting it at certain times is considered restricting what God Almighty and His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) have left open. Moreover, it is more appropriate to say it after Qur`anic recitation to fulfill the commandsof God. This is because tasdeeq of a matter (attesting to a matter) can only be after hearing it. Although there is no known non-Prophetic tradition mentioned on this, scholars also recommended making \"tasdeeq\" when hearing the words \"prayer is better that sleep\" [as-salatu khayrun min an-nawm]\" of the call for fajr prayer, after which one is to say, \"You have spoken the truth\". Moreover, the command to say \"Saddaqa Allahu Al-'Adhim\" was mentioned in a Prophetic hadith that was reported by al-Baihaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman. Although it is a weak hadith, yet it can be followed to encourage righteous acts."

    "Question": "I supervise a mosque in Gamasa where a reciter would recite the Qur`an audibly on Friday before the imam ascends the pulpit. We then decided with the mosque sheikh that each person should recite the Qur`an on his own instead. However, the majority of congregants demanded the reciter's audible recitation. Is this considered an innovation?",
    "Answer": "The command to recite the Qur`an is general. It is established in the principles of Islamic law that unrestricted matters demand their general application with regards to places, times, people and conditions. Therefore, it is impermissible to restrict this generality except with evidence; otherwise this would itself be considered an innovation in religion by restricting what Allah and His Messenger have left unrestricted.It is established in Islamic law that objectionable innovations are those newly introduced matters that contravene Islamic law. Newly introduced matters for which there is evidence in Islamic law that it is called for, are not rejected and their doer is not blameworthy. Consequently, reciting the Qur`an audibly before the Friday sermon is not an innovation since this falls under the general injunction of reciting the Qur`an. Based on this, restricting unrestricted matters and specifying the general without evidence is closer to innovation with regards to general matters unrestricted by Islamic law.Having a reciter recite the Qur`an on Friday and listening to him is among the commendable gatherings of dhikr (making remembrance of Allah) and Qur`anic recitations. Both the reciter and the listener are included in the hadith of the Prophet who said, \"No people gather in one of the houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and studying it among themselves, without tranquility descending upon them, mercy enveloping them, the angels surrounding them and Allah making mention of them amongst those who are with Him\" [Recorded by Imam Muslim from the hadith of Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him)].The rulingThere is no impediment to having a reciter recite the Qur`an before the sermon on Friday. This is not considered an innovation but a praiseworthy gathering for making dhikr and Qur`anic recitations.Allah the Almighty knows best"

    "Question": "What is the ruling for someone who began their fast in one country, then traveled to another or vice versa, and the country they moved to started fasting before their home country by one day or after it by one day?",
    "Answer": "Imam al-Nawawi has said as well as Sheikh al-Ramli in commenting on Imam al-Nawawi’s words in his famous juristic book Al Minhaj:“ Whoever has traveled from a country in which the new crescent has not been sighted ‘to another country in which the moon was sighted, then he breaks his fast with the later. Whether the person has fasted twenty eight days meaning that Ramadan is missing a day and he has Eid on the twenty ninth day of his fast or he has fasted twenty nine days so Ramadan is complete, “he makes up a day” if he has fasted only twenty eight days since the lunar month can not be such, however if he fasted twenty nine days then there is no expiation needed since the lunar month could be such. For this reason we see that it is best for the person traveling to follow the moon sighting of the country he is going to. If the amount of days he has fasted is less than twenty-nine days then he should fast an extra day after breaking his fast with the Eid celebration. If however, what he has fasted has reached thirty days, and the country he has gone to is still fasting, then he should withhold from eating, drinking and the like, but not with the intention of fasting as the lunar month never exceeds thirty days and is never less than twenty-nine days. However, he withholds from eating, drinking and the like so as not to harm or bother his fellow Muslims and to prevent social unrest among people who are ignorant of religious legal rulings.God is most high all knowledgeable."

    "Question": "What is the things which are prohibited during fasting",
    "Answer": "A fasting person must not vitiate his fast and lose its reward. He must restrain himself, [both physically and mentally], from doing or thinking of anything that incurs the wrath of Allah Almighty and which make him forfeit his fast. These include:Slander.Talebearing.Gossip.Looking at what Allah has prohibited.Quarrels and discord.Severing the ties of kinship.Abu Hurayra narrated that the prophet [pbuh] said: \"It may be that a fasting person may not receive anything from his fast except hunger, and it may be that a person praying Qiyaam [Night vigil prayers] at night may not receive anything in recompense except staying up late\" [Reported by al-Nisa`i, ibn Majah, and Ahmed. Ibn Khuzaimah, ibn Habban and al-Hakem declared it authentic].Anything that eliminates or diminishes piety eliminates or diminishes rewards because fasting was legislated to attain piety. Allah Almighty says:O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you that you may (learn) self-restraint [Al-Baqarah, 183].Allah Almighty knows best."

In addition, this hadith shows that it is not a condition that the fasting person be poor as the wording is general and includes all those who fast. God is the Most Generous; even if the act of feeding a fasting person is minimal as is indicated in the hadith, the reward is achieved.

Some of the people there are convinced of the prohibition of eating camel neck meat because the Messenger of Allahonce placed his noble feet on a camel's neck. I would like a clarification of the legal ruling for this issue",
    "Answer": "Ablution after eating camel meat There are two scholarly opinions on this matter. Scholars who have maintained that camel meat does not nullify ablution include Al-Thawri, Imam Malik, al-Shafi'i and ahl al-ra`y(1) . They based their opinion on the hadith narrated by Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said, \"The last of the two commands from the Messenger of Allah [on this matter] was to refrain from making ablution for eating anything cooked over fire\" [Recorded by Abu Dawud, al-Nisa`i, at-Tirmdhi and Ibn Majah. Ibn Hibban declared it authentic]. Scholars who have contested this opinion include Hanbali scholars and those who followed their opinion. They maintained that the ablution of a person who eats camel meat, raw or cooked, is nullified regardless of whether he knows what kind of meat it is. They based their opinion on the hadith of Al-Baraa` Ibn 'Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) who said, \"The Prophet was asked about camel meat and he said, 'Perform ablution after eating it.' When asked about mutton, he said, 'Do not perform ablution after eating it' [Recorded by Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah. Ibn Khuzaima and Ibn Hibban declared it authentic]. The majority of scholars have maintained that the report of Al-Baraa` and other reports were abrogated by Jabir's.The rulingThe opinion chosen for fatwa is that eating camel meat does not nullify ablution. It is lawful to eat camel neck meat. The fact that the Prophet placed his noble feet on it, if proven to be true, does not evidence its prohibition. The Prophet placed his noble hands on many animals and rode many others but their meat is not prohibited for consumption. The prohibition of eating camel neck meat cannot be proven except by explicit textual evidence.

    "Answer": "Evidence from Qur'anGod Almighty says, \"And they give food in spite of love for it to the needy, the orphan, and the captive, [Saying], \"We feed you only for the countenance of God. We wish not from you reward or gratitude.\" (Qur'an 76: 8-9) The captives are always from among the disbelievers. Evidence from Sunnahthe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, \"O people, provide food, maintain the ties of your kinship, spread peace and stand in prayer at night when others are sleeping, you will be peacefully granted the abode of Paradise [Jannah].\"The Prophet words are addresses to the generality of people which means feeding and exchanging food in general."

    "Question": "We, Polish Muslims, would like to bring to your attention that Muslims in Poland find difficulty dealing with the question of slaughtering and its legal permissibility, whether it be poultry, cows, or calves. We have found a Polish company willing to cooperate with us in this matter. Our question is: Is it sufficient to utter the name of Allah at the beginning of that day’s slaughter [in the morning] while intending what will be slaughtered throughout the entire day? We would also like to inform you that the chickens after the electrocution regain consciousness rather than dying. We have witnessed this with our own eyes, and this was after they had passed through an electrified water tank.",
    "Answer": "If it has been medically and scientifically established that the use of a method to control the animal before slaughtering which removes the animal from its normal vitality and results in death or involuntary movement - both of which contradict the conditions established in Islamic jurisprudence - then this method is impermissible in the Shari’ah. However if the effects were limited to weakening resistance or reducing pain - where, if not for being slaughtered, the animal would return to its normal vitality - then it is permissible to use this method in order to control the animal before its slaughter. This is because it does not contradict the basis of the Shari’ah with regard to slaughtering animals. As for uttering the name of Allah before slaughtering an animal, it is recommended (but not a necessary condition) according to the Shafi‘is and one Hanbali opinion. So there is no harm in failing to utter the name of Allah, and this applies whether the person slaughtering the animal is a Muslim, Christian, or Jew. Turning on a machine takes the place of slaughtering the animal by hand provided that the machine kills using a blade but not using another means. It is required that the operator of the machine be a Muslim, Christian, or Jew; it is not valid [for Muslim consumption] if the operator is an atheist or of any other faith. Based on this and in reference to the question: it is permissible to consume the meat provided that: • the machine kills using a blade and not by any other means; • the operator of the machines is a Muslim, Christian, or a Jew; and • the slaughtered animal is itself permissible to eat. Electrocution does not alter this permissibility so long as it is limited to weakening the resistance of the animal while retaining its vitality. As to the utterance of the name of Allah upon the slaughtered animal – after all of the above – is recommended. There is no harm if it is not said; this is according the opinion of the Shafi‘is and one of the Hanbali opinions. Allah the Almighty and the Most High knows best."

    "Question": "A person has established a safari park that includes all kinds of animals, both wild and tame. Is it permissible for him to feed the wild animals porcine meat?",
    "Answer": "The original permissibility of all things is established in Islamic law; thereby, nothing can be deemed prohibited except with textual evidence. The texts mentioning the prohibition of swine like the one mentioned below are meant for humans since the words of Allah are directed to them. Allah the Almighty says,Say: \"I find not in the Message received by me by inspiration any (meat) forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be dead meat, or blood oured forth, or the flesh of swine,--for it is an abomination—or what is impious, (meat) on which a name has been invoked, other than Allah's.\" [Al-An'am: 145]The rulingBased on the above, there is no objection to feeding wild animals and other animals not used for human consumption porcine meat. But because porcine meat is impure and prohibited, it is impermissible to give it to tame animals used for human consumption. Tame animals used for human consumption that are fed on porcine meat take the status of animals classified as jallala (animals that feed on ritually impure material); it is forbidden to eat the meat of these animals or benefit from them. This ruling is based on the hadith reported by 'Amr Ibn Shu'aib through his father who reported it through his grandfather (may Allah be pleased with them all) who said, \"On the day of Khaybar, the Messenger of Allahforbade us to eat the meat of wild asses, jallala — he forbade us to ride them or eat their meat\" [Ahmed and an-Nisa`i].This is in answer to the above and Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "A man made a vow and said, \"If my son recovers from his illness, I will feed the congregants attending Friday Prayer at this mosque.\" Is it permissible for the rich to partake of this food? Is it permissible for the rich to eat from the offering of a person who says, \"If my son recovers from his illness, I will sacrifice a sheep on the day of 'Eid ul-Adha.\"? I would like an answer based on Hanafi jurisprudence.",
    "Answer": "The vow is a sanctioned act of worship. It is invalid in Hanafi jurisprudence except if intended as an act of worship to gain the pleasure of Allah and is similar in kind to another obligatory act of worship. For this reason, it is permissible in Hanafi jurisprudence for a person to vow to give sadaqah [charity] since it is similar in kind to the obligatory act of worship of zakat. And since it is impermissible to give zakat to the rich, it is likewise impermissible to pledge to give them sadaqah. Pledging to give the object of one's vow to the rich, exclusively or inclusively, is tantamount to directing the vow to other than Allah which is impermissible. Furthermore, it would not be an act intended exclusively to gain the pleasure of Allah and is not similar in kind to another obligatory act of worship.The luminary Al-Haskafi stated in Al-Dur Al-Mukhtar that a person who makes an unrestricted or conditional vow similar in kind to an obligatory act of worship (apart from ablution or shrouding the dead [which are not acts of worship per se]) is obliged to fulfill it if the event upon which the vow was made contingent occurs. This is because of the report which states, 'Whoever pledges to make a vow and states it, must fulfill his vow.' This includes vows to fast, pray, give sadaqah, make endowments, i'tikaf [spiritual retreat], manumit a slave, or perform hajj (even if on foot). The obligation here is based on the fact that they are all similar in kind to acts of worship performed for the sake of gaining the pleasure of Allah and are similar in kind to obligatory acts of worship such as manumitting a slave in expiation, going for hajj on foot for a resident of Makkah (for a person who is capable of it), the length of sitting back after the last testification of faith which is similar to i'tikaf or endowing a mosque for the benefit of Muslims (this is primarily the duty of a Muslim leader that must be executed from the Muslim Common Fund; otherwise, it is a duty upon Muslims). It is not obligatory for a Muslim to fulfill a vow which is not similar in kind to an obligatory act of worship such as visiting the sick, joining a funeral procession or entering a mosque (even if it were the Prophet's Mosque or Masjid al-Aqsa) since it is not similar in kind to an obligatory act of worship intended exclusively to Allah. This is the criteria for making vows as mentioned in Al-Durar. Al-Haskafi said that in addition to the above, the book Zawaher Al-Jawaher mentions that a vow must not comprise an impossible task such as fasting or making i'tikaf on a past day since the vow would then be invalid. In Al-Qunya, it is mentioned that vowing to give sadaqah to the rich is invalid unless it is made to a wayfarer. In reference to the statement in Al-Qunya on this issue, Ibn Nujaim mentions that it is valid to give a sadaqah to a wayfarer since he is from among the legal recipients of zakat. It is invalid for a person to pledge to host the rich for the sake of Allah upon the return of an absent loved one.Ibn 'Abdin wrote in Rad Al-Muhtar 'ala Al-Dur Al-Mukhtar (4/41) that the reason behind the invalidity of giving a sadaqah to a rich person may be that it is not an act of worship and it is impossible to consider it as such. This is because to a rich person a dinar is a gift, while to a poor person, a gift is a sadaqah. Al-Tahtawi said in his commentary on Al-Dur Al-Mukhtar that the reason for its invalidity is because it is not similar in kind to an obligatory act of worship and its validity to a wayfarer is due to him being one of the legal recipients of zakat. Fatawa Hindiyyah, mentions the invalidity of pledging to give out a dinar as a sadaqah to a rich person except if he were a wayfarer.In the book Al-Bahr al-Ra`ik Sharh Kinz al-Daqa`iq, Ibn Nujaym cited al-Sheikh Qasim who mentioned in Sharh Al-Durar that vows made by the majority of the general public, according to what is witnessed, are invalid. Instances of such vows include a person who has an absent or ill loved one or has a pressing need, approaching [the grave of] a pious person and places a sheet over his head, and says, 'O my such-and-such a master! If my absent loved one is returned to me, or if my ill is healed or if my need is fulfilled, then for you is so much gold or silver or water or food, or wax or oil.' Scholars are unanimous on the invalidity of such a vow on account of a number of reasons which include:It is a vow made to person. This is impermissible because a vow is an act of worship and worship must not be directed to Allah's creation.It is a vow made to a deceased and a dead person is incapable of possessing anything.A person makes a vow to a deceased believing that he, apart from Allah, has power to fulfill his need. Such a belief is tantamount to kufr [disbelief] except if he says, 'O Allah! I hereby pledge that if You heal my ill, return my absent loved one, or fulfill my need, I will feed the poor at the door of Sayyidah Nafisah, or the poor who are at the door of Imam Shafi'i or Imam Layth or buy mats for their mosques, or oil to light them, or give dirhams to those who worship inside,\" and so forth of other things in which there is a benefit for the poor and the offering is made to Allah. Mentioning the name of the sheikh after whom the mosque or area is named is for the purpose of designating the recipients of the vow who are present in the environs of the place or mosque. It is for this reason that vows made in this manner are permissible.The object of a vow is distributed among the poor and accordingly, it is impermissible to distribute it among the rich, a person of noble rank or birth (due to his rank or family name) or a scholar (due to his knowledge) unless he is poor. There is nothing in Islamic law to substantiate giving the object of the vow to the rich.Based on the above and on the opinion of Hanafi scholars, a vow is invalid if it is distributed to both the poor and rich from among the congregants of a mosque since it is impermissible to feed the rich from it. However, Hanafis maintain two opinions regarding redressing an invalid vow by distributing it to the poor:Some Hanafi scholars have maintained the invalidity of rectifying such a vow since it is primarily impermissible to give the rich from the object of the vow. Ibn 'Abdin mentions in Tanqih Al-Fatawa Al-Hamidiyya that a question was posited to him about a man who was heard to have said that if he takes his daughter from her grandfather, he pledges to contribute a certain sum of money to the kitchens of the governor. The question revolved around whether he is to fulfill his vow if he does take his daughter from her grandfather. Ibn 'Abdin answered that such a vow is invalid since it cannot be directed to a person [and it is therefore non-binding]. A case cannot be filed against him concerning the vow nor can a judge adjudicate in favor of its fulfillment."

    "Question": "What is the ruling on using extracts (ex. vanilla extract), for baking and cooking? As most are made with alcohol.",
    "Answer": "The legal ruling for this issue and its like is based on two matters; Istihlak (consumption) and Istihala (conversion) and likewise their effect on removing a substance's impurity [najasa] and on rendering it permissible for human consumption.Meaning of Istihala:Istihala means the transformation of a substance's properties resulting in the removal of its impure nature. Scholars have unanimously agreed that alcohol is deemed pure if it transforms into vinegar.The majority of Hanafi and Maliki scholars as well as in an opinion stated by Imam Ahmed, they maintained that any impure substance can be deemed pure if it has undergone Istihala (apart from wine turning into vinegar). This is because the impure nature of such a substance is transformed and completely changed. Since Islamic law bases the description of impurity on the presence of certain properties, its description as impure no longer applies due to transformation in its essence. This opinion is based on the case of the purity of alcohol which transforms into vinegar, the purity of deer's blood transforming into musk and the purity of a blood clot after transforming into a piece of flesh [during gestation]. This is the opinion implemented for fatwa.As for Istihlak (consumption), it means that the percentage of alcohol in a certain substance is so negligible that it does not lead to intoxication, even if a person drinks large amounts of it. A beverage is deemed prohibited for human consumption if the percentage of alcohol in it leads to intoxication whether or not it is drunk in little amounts. This is in correspondence to the hadith narrated by Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (pbuh) said, \"Any beverage that intoxicates when taken in large quantities is unlawful both in small and large quantities.\" [Recorded by Abu Dawud and al-Nisa'i. Ibn Hibban declared it authentic from a hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him)]. The meaning of this is that any drink that intoxicates is forbidden in small amounts because drinking small amounts that do not intoxicate may lead to drinking large amounts that do. However, it is lawful to drink beverages that have been mixed with minute quantities of an intoxicating substance, and does not lead to intoxication even if drunk in large amounts. This does not come under this noble hadith and its like.The above mentioned [impermissibility] applies if we consider alcohol impure. However, Sheikh Mohammed Bekheit al-Miti'i, the grand Hanafi imam and former mufti of Egypt, verified the matter and issued a fatwa stating that chemical alcohol is not considered wine in the first place. Accordingly, it is pure unless it is derived from wine.Najasa (impurity) is a legal issue and not a chemical fact in the sense that the impurity of khamr (wine) is determined by the shari'ah. It is a chemical fact that alcohol is the intoxicating element in alcoholic drinks. However, this chemical fact does not necessarily render alcohol impure or prohibited if it is found in any liquid other than khamr. This is because the impurity of a compound does not necessitate the impurity of its elements. The impurities upon which there is consensus such as human urine and stool consist of chemical elements which can be found not only in pure entities but also in food and drink. However, the najasa and filth of these substances are caused by the composition of certain constituents in a certain percentage. Fermentation is caused by the presence of sugars without which the process of fermentation is impossible however long the [food or drink] is left to ferment, such as colocynth.Fermentation is the conversion of sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid. Thus, the fermented liquid becomes an intoxicant due to the presence of alcohol. Pure alcohol is not an intoxicant, but it is harmful to health. Drinking pure alcohol causes either slumber or brain damage. To convert alcohol into khamr, it must be mixed with 3 times its amount of water, then distilled at which time it is converted into an intoxicant. The addition of water gives khamr intoxicating properties. The reason behind the variety of intoxicants depends on the differences in the intoxicating effect resulting from the ratio of water and alcohol. Arrack contains 40% alcohol or more. Other kinds of alcoholic drinks contain 10% alcohol. Fiqa', derived from barley, contains 5% alcohol and so forth. Pure alcohol is a poisonous substance and does not become intoxicating unless it is mixed with water."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6248/how-much-alcohol-is-a-muslim-permitted-to-drink",
    "Question": "How much alcohol is a Muslim permitted to drink?",
    "Answer": "Muslims are not allowed to drink alcohol even in small quantities. The reason behind the prohibition relates mainly to the intoxicating effect that alcohol has on the faculty of reason in human beings. The mind is of utmost importance because it is the recipient of the divine message and legal rulings. In other words, the accountability of human beings is solely determined by their mental capacity. People are not held accountable for anything when they are asleep or under the effect of anesthesia for surgical procedures.Because drinking was a deeply rooted practice in pre-Islamic Arabia, alcohol was prohibited gradually. This occurred in four stages. The first was the subtle disapproval of alcohol in the Quran when God the Almighty said: “… and grapevines you take intoxicant and good provision” (Quran 16: 67). In this verse, God the Almighty described grapes as wholesome and good but did not describe the state of inebriation they produced as either pleasant or good. This implicit disapproval was well understood by the Arabs who inferred from these words God’s disapproval. The second stage was when God the Almighty prohibited Muslims to approach prayers in a state of intoxication and said: “O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying…” (Quran 4: 43). The third stage was when God the Almighty revealed that though alcohol has benefits, its harm outweighs its benefits: “They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, \"In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit” (2:219). The last stage of prohibition was when God stated clearly its prohibition: “O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than God], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful” (Quran 5: 90).We understand that in a society where pubs are part of the popular culture, Muslims might face some difficulties in changing their lifestyle to refrain from consuming intoxicants. They should therefore try to engage themselves in other social activities which are free from anything prohibited.And God the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to catch frogs and, after slaughtering, export them to lands where they are eaten?",
    "Answer": "This is a multifaceted issue since it discusses the rulings of catching, slaughtering, and exporting frogs to be eaten. The issue of exporting frogs is built upon the issue of slaughtering them, and the matters return to the ruling of killing them. There are hadiths which forbid killing frogs. One of them is the hadith narrated by ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Uthman who said that the Prophet forbade killing frogs [Ahmed, Abu Dawud, al-Nasa’i, Ibn Majah; al-Hakim declared it authentic and al-Dhahabi remained silent]. Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet forbade killing shrikes, frogs, ants and hoopoes [Ibn Majah]. ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Omar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said that The Prophet forbade killing frogs and said: “Its croaking is tasbeeh (praising God).\" [al-Tabarani in al-Saghir and al-Awsat]In his Sunnan, al-Bayhaqi included the hadith narrated by Ibn 'Amr (may Allah be pleased with them both): Do not kill frogs; indeed, its croaking is tasbeeh.al-Bayhaqi said that its chain of transmission is authentic. Because of this, the Hanafis, Shafi‘is, Hanbalis, Zahiris and many other scholars consider it prohibited to eat frogs due to the juristic rule that everything which has been forbidden to kill is [also] forbidden to eat, since if it were permissible to eat it would have been permissible to kill. Some other scholars permit consuming frogs, based upon the generality of the words of Allah the Almighty: It is permitted for you to catch and eat seafood [5:96]and due to the generality of the well known hadith: “Its water is purifying and its dead are lawful.\" This opinion is reported from Malik, Ibn Abi Laila, al-Sha‘bi, and al-Thawri in one of his two opinions. In addition to this, they considered the hadiths about killing frogs to be weak. We side with the opinion held by the majority scholars who prohibit eating frogs based upon their prohibition of killing it, which is itself based upon the ‘People of Hadith’ considering the hadith concerning the subject to be fair. Based on the above and in reference to the question: it is impermissible for you to hunt, slaughter, and export frogs. And Allah knows best."

    "Answer": "A1:Yes, it is permissible to commission a legal entity to slaughter a sacrificial animal and distribute its meat on behalf of others.Question 1A1:Yes, it is permissible to commission a legal entity to slaughter a sacrificial animal and distribute its meat on behalf of others.A2- Any statement which includes commissioning another to slaughter an animal and distribute its meat on another's behalf is sufficient. However, any general or specific conditions must be stated.A3- No, this is not permissible. A cow must be over two full years, although it is permissible to overlook this condition if the younger animal is plump and has nearly as much meat as that meeting the age requirement.A4- Any money in excess of the costs is to be saved to buy the following year's sacrificial animals.A5- The sacrificial animal is slaughtered either in fulfillment of a vow or as a sunna and this must be clearly stated in the agreement between the two parties. If the animal is in fulfillment of a vow, then it must be compensated for by the bank. Otherwise, the food bank is liable only if the animals die as a result of negligence or aggression against them. This is because the bank is considered a trust; if it does not slaughter another animal on behalf of the person who commissioned it to do so, then it is to inform him so he can either slaughter another animal himself or do as he sees fit. He will be rewarded for his efforts and for what he has spent; however, he will not have fulfilled the sunna of slaughtering a sacrificial animal except if it is slaughtered at the prescribed time.A6- The time for slaughtering starts after 'Eid Prayer and continues until sunset of the last day of the three days following 'Eid [Ar.

This is because the Prophet said: \"If the tool, other than a nail or a tooth, used to slaughter an animal causes its blood to gush out and the name of Allah is mentioned, then eat [from the slaughtered animal]\" [Reported by Al-Bayhaqi and Abu Dawud, may Allah be pleased with them].Based on this, if the bird is not slaughtered and resumes its vitality after being electrically stunned, it is permissible to use this method and eat from the meat of this animal after slaughtering it. If the birds are not slaughtered after passing through the electrically charged water tank, but die from the effect of stunning, then they are considered unslaughtered animals which are prohibited to eat in Islam.The RulingThis method of slaughter is permissible according to the Islamic law if: - If it is certain that the electrically charged water will not kill the birds nor cause blood to gush out from them - The birds are slaughtered when they pass through the second machine.Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "How is the sacrificial animal divided? Is [every part] divided into thirds i.e. the liver into thirds, the head into thirds, etc…? How is it divided into thirds?",
    "Answer": "Sacrifice is a confirmed practice of the Prophet because he offered sacrifice and so did the successors, and because He said:\"Three are obligatory upon me and voluntary for you; sacrifice, and the two rak'ahs of Morning Prayer [En: Daybreak Prayers]\".Islamic law clarified how to dispose and divide the sacrificial animal. It is recommended to divide the sacrificed animal into three thirds; one third is eaten, another third is given away as gifts, and the last third is given as charity. There is no harm if more than one third is eaten or given as a charity. This is because distributing the animal is recommended and not an obligation.Ibn 'Umar [May Allah be pleased with them] said:\"Sacrifice animals are divided [into three thirds]; one third for you, a third for your family, and a third for the poor \".The meat is [the part of the animal which is] distributed because it is the main objective, and is the part which benefits the poor and the needy. As for the innards such as the liver and other [parts], it is recommended to divide them, though there is no harm if they are not. The head is not distributed but belongs to the person offering the sacrifice— it must not be sold or given to the butcher as payment.It is obligatory to sacrifice an animal if one has vowed to do so and the person offering the sacrifice may eat from it and give it away as gifts and charity to the poor and the needy.Al-Qadi abu al-Tayib states that the Hanabli school maintain that it is impermissible for the owner of the vowed sacrifice animal to eat from it, which is the apparent meaning of the words of imam Ahmed.The reliable opinion for this fatwa is that it is permissible to eat from the sacrificed animal. This is because vows follow prescribed rulings and the prescribed rulings concerning the legal conditions of the sacrificial animal is that it is slaughtered to be eaten. The fact that the animal is slaughtered in fulfillment of a vow does not change anything except being an obligation.Allah the Majestic knows best."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to sacrifice young animals that are plump? Or must they meet the age requirement of sacrificial animals even though they may be lean?",
    "Answer": "Slaughtering a sacrificial animal is a confirmed sunna for those who are capable, following the actions of the Prophet [pbuh] who said, \"There are three things which are obligatory for me and voluntary for you: observing witr prayer, animal sacrifice and observing the duha prayer [mid-morning prayer]\" [Reported in Ahmed's Musnad]. Age requirementIn consideration of the interest of the poor and the destitute, Islam stipulated a certain age for sacrificial animals based on the expectation that they be fully grown and therefore have a lot of meat. If sacrificial animals meeting the age requirement prescribed in Islamic law are emaciated and there are other animals that do not meet the age requirement but have a lot of flesh (as is the case at present when animals are fed concentrated diets to increase their bulk but when they reach a certain age they start losing weight), Islam takes into consideration the needs of people, for this is one of the objectives of Islamic law. If a plump animal meeting the age requirement is not available while a younger one with a lot of meat is, it is then permissible to offer the younger animal as a sacrifice due to the words of the Prophet [pbuh] who said, \"Do not slaughter anything but a mussinah. But if this is difficult, slaughter a jadh'ah\" [Muslim]. A musinnah is a two-year-old cow. A jadh'ah is a one-year-old male sheep.By analogy, it is permissible to sacrifice a young and plump animal instead of an emaciated one meeting the age requirement when there is a need; and needs sometimes reach the status of necessities, be they public or individual. Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) is reported to have said, \"[For sacrifice], I consider nothing except a rooster.\" The rulingBased on this and in reference to the question, it is permissible to offer a young sacrificial animal that is plump."

The sacrifice is accepted by Allah before the blood reaches the ground, so sacrifice with an open and happy heart.The person offering a voluntary sacrifice is permitted to eat from his sacrifice or take benefit from it – from its meat, innards, and skin – in part or in whole; he may give it as charity – in part or in whole – or as a gift – in part or in whole.

    "Question": "What is the ruling if a man engages in sexual intercourse with his wife during the fasting hours of a fast which was an obligatory make up fast for either of them?",
    "Answer": "Engaging in sexual intercourse during the fasting hours of Ramadan If a man is fasting and engages in sexual intercourse during the fasting hours of Ramadan, he must: • Make the maximum kaffara [expiation].• Make up the fast.• Fast sixty consecutive days.In addition, he is to repent from this sin by regretting having committed it and resolving never to commit it again.If it was only the wife who was fasting, he is not obliged to make kaffara or make up the fast. As for the woman who breaks her fast by engaging in sexual intercourse during an obligatory fast, she must only make up the fast and is not obliged to make kaffara because the Prophet ordered the man who vitiated his fast on Ramadan to make kaffara and did not order him to tell his wife to do likewise. Since the principle is that it is not permissible to delay the clarification of a matter beyond its time, therefore, it has become known that a woman in such circumstances is only to make up the fast and repent. But if she was not fasting, she is not obliged to either make up the fast or make expiation.Engaging in sexual intercourse during the fasting hours of a make up fast of Ramadan Al-Qurtubi mentioned in his Tafsir that the majority of scholars have maintained that a person who vitiates a make up fast of Ramadan by engaging in sexual intercourse is blameworthy. He must make up this day but is not obliged to make expiation. They based their opinion on the hadith narrated by Um Hani` (may Allah be pleased with her) who said that on the days of Mecca's conquest, the Prophet offered her to drink from his cup after he had drunk first. After drinking, she said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I was fasting but I did not wish to decline the generosity of the Messenger of Allah.\" He asked her, \"Were you making up a fast?\" \"No,\" she replied. He then said, \"Then there is no harm\" [Recorded by Abu Dawud, al-Baihaqi and others].In Al-Nisa`i's version of the hadith recorded in Al-Sunan Al-Kubra, the Prophet told Um Hani`, \"If you are making up a missed day of Ramadan, then fast a day in its place. If not, you may do as you please—either make up a day in its place or do not.\" Due to this, Ibn Rushd wrote in Bidayat Al-Mujtahid (vol. 1, p. 224): \"The majority of scholars are unanimous that kaffara is not due upon a person who deliberately breaks a make up fast of Ramadan because it is not have the same sanctity i.e. of Ramadan.\"The rulingThe inquirer must fast another day in lieu of the make up fast day of Ramadan and he is not obliged to make kaffara following the opinion of the majority of scholars.Allah the Almighty knows best."

Upon wearing contact lenses a drop of the solution usually enters the eyes and travels to the nasal passage and throat.3- Using skin nourishing moisturizing creams, ointments and hair nourishing oils which are absorbed by the skin and scalp.4- Using injections (pain killers, antibiotics, etc ...).5- Using saline solutions, glucose and mannitol (a diuretic used by patients suffering from ocular hypertension).6- Using moisturizing lip balms.",
    "Answer": "Questions 1 & 2Scholars have differed over the ruling for using eye drops during fasting. The dominant opinion of the Hanafis and the apparent position of the Shafi'is is that eye drops do not vitiate fasting. According to them, the reason is because eye drops are not inconsistent with fasting which means abstaining from food and drink. They do not invalidate fasting even if the eye drops can be tasted in the throat because the eyes are not an open body orifice.Maliki and Hanbali scholars maintained that using eye drops nullifies fasting if the drops reach the throat because, according to them, the eye is an orifice, although not a usual one.Since the eyes are not considered an open orifice, we opine that anything that enters the eyes, solutions or medicine, does not nullify fasting even if it reaches the throat. The taste of the eye drops in the throat does not mean that the eyes are orifices; rather, they reach the throat through the skin.Question 3Hanafi and Shafi'i scholars as well as Ad-Dardir from among the Malikis have maintained that oils and creams rubbed on the head and abdomen do not invalidate fasting even if they reach an internal body cavity through the pores. This is because they do not reach an internal body cavity through an open orifice and because they are consistent with fasting. According to Al-Mirghani in Al-Hidaya, oils and creams provide a kind of relief and are not among the things that nullify the fast.The Malikis maintained in their well known opinion, that if a person can taste the oils and creams in his throat, he must make up his fast due to the established principle of their school which states, \"Any liquid that reaches the throat, even through other than the mouth, invalidates fasting.\"We maintain the opinion of the Shafi'i and Hanafi scholars, that oils and creams do not break the fast, relying on their authentic and strong evidences.Questions 4 & 5Injections, saline solution, glucose and mannitol do not invalidate fasting because they do not enter the body through an open orifice but through the skin. They are absorbed by the skin and there is no difference between this and injecting them into the body.Question 6Lip balm takes the same ruling mentioned above for oils and creams. It does not invalidate fasting provided it is absorbed by the lips and is not swallowed.The above answers the question and Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the things which invalidate the fast?",
    "Answer": "Whoever eats or drinks deliberately during the fasting hours of Ramadan invalidates his fast according to scholarly consensus.Making up a missed fast dayScholars of some schools of jurisprudence maintain that a person who deliberately breaks his fast must only make up the day he broke his fast while others maintain that such a person must make it up in conjunction with expiation.Expiation for deliberately breaking the fastA person who deliberately breaks his fast must fast 60 days consecutively. If unable to, then he must feed 60 poor persons. All scholars are unanimous that a person who deliberately eats or drinks during the fasting hours of Ramadan is blameworthy for violating the sanctity of the rite.Eating or drinking absentmindedlyAccording to the opinion of the Maliki school, a person who eats or drinks absentmindedly must continue his fast and only make up the missed fast day. Scholars of the other schools maintain that eating or drinking absentmindedly does not invalidate the fast and the fast of such a person is valid; he does not have to make it up. This is the preponderant opinion.Things which invalidate fastingDeliberate sexual intercourse during the fasting hours of Ramadan (by deliberate we mean that one knows a certain act is unlawful during an obligatory fast and remembers that one is fasting but does it anyway). According to all the schools of jurisprudence, such a person must make up the missed fast day as well as make expiation. Some schools maintain that both spouses are to make expiation. Others maintain that only the husband must do so and that the wife must only make up the fast even though both are blameworthy and share the sin of disobedience.Deliberate vomiting. Any liquids or solids that reach the body cavity invalidate fasting. It is a condition in the Hanafi and Maliki school that solids must settle in the stomach to invalidate fasting.Applying kohl. According to some scholars, the fast is invalidated if kohl is applied during the fasting hours of Ramadan and one can feel its taste in the throat or mouth. Abu Hanifa and al-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with them, maintain that kohl does not invalidate the fast even if applied during the fasting hours of Ramadan. They base their opinion on reports narrating that the prophet [pbuh] used to apply kohl during the fasting hours of Ramadan.

    "Answer": "Ramadan is the month of the Qur`an. Allah says: Ramadan is the month in which the Qur`an, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion, was revealed. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey—then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify for that [to] which He had guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful [Al-Baqarah, 185].Indeed, We sent it down during a blessed night. Indeed, We were to warn [mankind] [Ad-Dukhan, 3].Indeed, We sent the Qur`an down during the Night of Decree [Al-Qadr, 1].'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The prophet was the most generous of people, and he was most generous during Ramadan when Jibril would meet him. Jibril used to meet [the prophet] every night of Ramadan to teach him the Qur`an. Jibril would find him quick to extend his generosity—even quicker than the strongest wind\" [Bukhari and Muslim].Fatima, may Allah be pleased with her, narrated that her father informed her that Jibril, peace be upon him, would recite the Qur`an to him once a year but recited it twice on the year of his death [Bukhari and Muslim].The above hadiths demonstrate the preference of reciting the Qur`an and completing it once or more than once in Ramadan and reciting it day or night in abundance though at night is better and garners a greater reward. Allah says:Night prayers makes a deeper impression and sharpen words [Al-Muzammil, 6].In a hadith Qudsi, Allah says: \"My servant continues to draw closer to me with supererogatory prayers so that I shall love him. If I love him, I shall be the hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hands with which he holds, and his feet with which he walks. If he asks [something] of Me, I will surely give it to him and if he seeks takes refuge in me I will grant it to him. I do not hesitate about anything as much as I hesitate about [seizing] the soul of a faithful servant; he hates death and I hate hurting him\" [Bukhari].Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Answer": "Fasting is one of the obligations prescribed by Islam and one which Allah has made conditional upon [a person's] ability. Therefore, if a person is unable to fast, he has the dispensation to refrain from this duty. Rather, if fasting is detrimental to his health, a matter which is determined by a medical specialist, then it is obligatory upon him to refrain from fasting to preserve his health. However, if his illness is acute, then he is obliged to make up his missed fast days once he restores his health. Otherwise, if heis chronically illness such as with certain conditions associated with old age and the like, he is not obliged to make up his unperformed fast days but must make a fidya which consists of feeding a poor person for each day he has missed, depending on hisfinancial ability. It is likewise permissible to pay the cash value of the meal.

To my knowledge, a pregnant woman has the dispensation to refrain from fasting the month of Ramadan. Allah the Almighty has made it possible for me to make expiation of feeding 30 poor people for the 30 days I will refrain from fasting.My question is: Is it obligatory for me to make up these fast days after giving birth? Please note that I intend to breastfeed my child if possible, and it is not recommended to fast during the nursing period. I am due to give birth next May by the will of Allah and the upcoming Ramadan will coincide with the weaning period.Please give me a definite answer on whether it suffices to feed 30 needy persons or if it is necessary to make up the fast days. If necessary, how and when do I to make them up?",
    "Answer": "As long as a specialized physician has advised you against fasting on account of your pregnancy, then you may follow her recommendation. However, you must make up the unperformed fast days after Ramadan; expiation alone is not sufficient if you are able to fast after giving birth. It is not necessary to make up the missed fast days immediately after Ramadan; its time is extendable i.e. you can make them up at any time. It has been authentically reported that 'A`isha (may Allah be pleased with her) used to make up her unperformed fast days of Ramadan in the month of Sha'ban. If she delayed making them up until the next Ramadan, she would fast the current Ramadan and make up her unperformed fast days afterwards. She would not make expiation if her delay was due to an excuse, otherwise she would make expiation in addition to making up her unperformed fast days.The rulingThe inquirer whose physician advised against fasting must make up her unperformed fast days whenever it becomes possible for her, whether or not she makes them up consecutively. The expiation she made does not discharge her of the obligation of making up the unperformed fast days due to the words of Allah Almighty Who says,The prescribed number (should be made up) from days later. [Al-Baqarah: 184]This is because she can fast on other days and because her unperformed fast days are a debt owed to Allah; a debt owed to Allah has more right to be fulfilled.Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "My mother passed away without making up her missed fast days of Ramadan and this fact is known to all her children. Is it permissible to pay kaffara [expiation] on her behalf from the money she left?",
    "Answer": "Breaking the fast due to an excuse that lasts until deathScholars concur that a person is not to pay kaffara or make up the fast on behalf of a deceased who broke his fast due to an excuse that continued until his death since the deceased did not neglect to fast and is therefore not blameworthy. Like Hajj which is an obligatory act of worship that is waived from upon those who are unable to perform it, fasting in this case, is likewise an obligatory act that the deceased was unable to fulfill until his death and therefore, it is waived from upon him.Scholarly opinions on a person whose excuse for breaking his fast ceases but neglects to make up his fast until his deathThe opinion of the majority of Hanafi and Maliki scholars, the latter opinion of the Shafi'i and the preponderant opinion in the Hanbali school A person is not to make up the missed fast days on behalf of the deceased, but is to give out two handfuls for each missed fast day. The reason is because like prayers, a person cannot commission another to fast on his behalf during his lifetime, and the same holds true after death. Scholars from among ahl al-Hadith (traditionalists) and some scholars from among the Salaf (the Successors) such as Tawus, al-Hasan al-Basri, al-Zahri, Qutadah, abu al-Thawr and Imam al-Shafi'i in his former opinion and the established opinion of the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence and abu al-Khattab, the Hanbali scholar, all maintain that it is permissible for a relative of the deceased to fast on his behalf. Shafi'i scholars added that this fulfills the obligation without having to pay kaffara and absolves the deceased of the obligation. Relatives of the deceased may choose either to fast or make kaffara on behalf of the deceased, although fasting is better.Evidence- 'A`isha, may Allah be pleased with her, narrated that the Prophet [pbuh] said, \"Whoever dies with unfulfilled fast days, a relative is to fast on his behalf\" [Bukhari and Muslim]. - Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, said, \"A man came to the Prophet [pbuh] and said, 'O Messenger of Allah! My mother passed away and she has a month of unfulfilled fast days. Should I fast this month on her behalf?' The Prophet replied, 'If your mother were indebted, would you settle the debt on her behalf?'The man replied in the affirmative, whereupon the Prophet [pbuh] said, 'A debt owed to Allah has more right to be fulfilled.' \" The opinion of Imam Ahmed, al-Layth, Is-haq and abu 'UbaidA person cannot fast on behalf of a deceased except if the fast were in fulfillment of a vow. They based their opinion on the general implication of the hadith narrated by the Mother of the Believers, 'A`isha, may Allah be pleased with her, and the specific scenario expressed in the hadith narrated by ibn 'Abbas, the narration of which indicated that the fast was in fulfillment of a vow. Al-NawawiImam Nawawi wrote in Sharh Muslim: \"This opinion i.e. the permissibility of making up the obligatory fast on behalf of a deceased—is the correct and chosen opinion in our school. It is likewise the opinion authenticated by the luminaries from among both ahl al-Hadith and ahl al-Ra`y (exponents of reasoning) which they based on the authentic and explicit hadiths [mentioned above]. The hadith that states: \"Whoever dies and has some unfulfilled fast days, a kaffara is to be paid on his behalf\" is not established as authentic. Even if it were, it would be possible to establish agreement between the two hadiths and act upon both since scholars who maintain that a person is to pay kaffara on behalf of a deceased deem it permissible to fast on his behalf and those who maintain that a person is to fast on behalf of a deceased deem it permissible to make kaffara on his behalf. A relative may choose either alternative; although it is not obligatory upon him to fast on behalf of the deceased, it is recommended.\" Who is to fast on behalf of a deceased?Any relative of the deceased may fast on his behalf; a non-relative may also fast but only with the permission a relative. The RulingYou may choose either to fast on behalf of your mother or feed a poor person for each of her unfulfilled missed fast days. According to Shafi'I scholars, the kaffara consists of one mudd of wheat, dates or any of the staple food of the country. A mudd is half a kilo approximately. You may calculate the number of fast days your mother missed and divide them among you and your siblings, each one is free to choose how to make them up. If you choose to feed the poor, there is no objection to giving out the value of the food in cash.Reciting the Fatiha for the deceasedThere is no objection to reciting surat al Fatiha for each deceased separately and donating its reward to him or reciting it a single time for a number of deceased and donating the reward to them. It is permissible to do both by the will of God.God Almighty knows best"

    "Question": "Is it permissible to study and learn about astronomy? Can you rely on astronomical calculations to ascertain the beginning of Ramadan?",
    "Answer": "Islam does not oppose knowledge and learning nor does it stand in their way. On the contrary, Islam encourages studying, thinking about and contemplating in the universe, and deriving scientific theories that benefit humanity. The Quran says, “Say: Behold what is in the heavens and the earth! But revelations and warnings avail not folk who will not believe” (10:101); and it says, “Say (O Muhammad): Travel in the land and see how He originated creation, then God brings forth the later growth. Lo! God is Able to do all things” (29:20).Astronomy is one of the fields whose study and knowledge are explicitly encouraged in the Quran in order to study cosmic phenomena to gain knowledge of their inner secrets. This is found in the following verse: “And We appoint the night and the day two portents. Then We make dark the portent of the night, and We make the portent of the day sight- giving, that ye may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the computation of the years, and the reckoning; and everything have We expounded with a clear expounding” (Quran17:12). This is also found in the following, “And the sun runs [on course] towards its stopping place. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise. And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old shrivelled palm-leaf. It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day. They float each in an orbit (Quran 36: 38-40).Muslims encountered astronomy and gained proficiency in all of its equations and put it to work in the service of their religion. They calculated the time of dawn, sunrise, noon, afternoon, sunset, and nightfall so that the person who made the call to prayer would do so after consulting a sheet with the correct times written on it according to the astronomical calculations. Muslims stopped seeking guidance by placing a stick in the ground and measuring its shadow, although a person may still find themselves in need of this method if they do not have a watch or do not know the local times of prayer.What is provided by Islamic Law is both easy and readily available to all people, because Islam is a universal religion. Ascertaining the times of prayer and fasting by way of astronomical calculations is not in opposition with the prophetic methodology. The strange thing is that we find no difference of opinion concerning prayer, while there is great difference of opinion concerning fasting, even though prayer is more important.Concerning fasting in Ramadan, the origin of ascertaining the beginnings of all the Arab months including Ramadan is the visual sighting of the new moon. The Quran says, “And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month” (2:185). And the Prophet said, “Begin your fast according to the sighting of it [i.e. the new moon] and end your fast according to the sighting of it.”There is no doubt that the appearance of the new moon is an established physical phenomenon, and there is no argument concerning the possibility of perceiving it with the naked eye when the conditions for physically sighting it are met. This could be done in addition to the assured scientific means that are agreed upon and are now known to specialists. These means are known to both Muslims and non-Muslims as the new moon is a scientific reality according to the consensus of astronomers and there is no conjecture involved.Al-Subki was asked about someone who sighted the new moon and was alone in his testimony in a case where calculations belied him. Al-Subki responded with a long answer, the relevant part of which is the following, “This is another manifestation: when the calculations state that it is not possible to sight the new moon and this conclusion is reached based on sound and certain premises because of the closeness of the moon to the sun, in this case you cannot allow for the physical sighting of the new moon since it is impossible.If one or more people, whose information is open to being belied or incorrect, inform us of it [i.e. that they sighted the new moon], the position taken is to understand their information as a fabrication or a misapprehension. If two people were to testify to its sighting, their testimonies would not be accepted since the calculations are certain and the testimony and informing is uncertain, and what is uncertain does not disclaim what is certain let alone take precedence over it.The condition of the declaration [i.e. of the sighting of the moon] is that what is being bore witness to is physically, intellectually, and legally possible. If the evidence of the calculations indicates the certain impossibility [of sighting the new moon] it is legally impossible to accept it due to the impossibility of that which is being sighted since the law does not advance impossibilities.”For this reason our opinion is that it is better to act in accordance with astronomical calculations since they have been subsumed under empirical and certain knowledge which makes relying on them give one certainty, as has preceded. As for the sighting with the naked eye, it is uncertain due to the possibility of there being barriers that can come in the way of the sighting of the new moon which gives precedence to considering astronomical calculations where there is a discrepancy.And God Almighty knows best."

    "Answer": "Sighting the crescent of Ramadan The Prophet [pbuh] said, \"Fast when you sight the crescent and end your fast when you sight it. Should the crescent be obscured by clouds, then complete thirty days of Sha'ban.\" Based on this hadith, if your country undertakes the sighting, then you are to follow it whether or not the crescent is sighted and it is impermissible to follow the sighting of another country.

In this case, one may follow astronomical calculations and the beginning of the month of Shawwal is established according to their calculations.Based on the above and in reference to the question, the citizens of Mozambique or others must determine the last day of Ramadan and the first day of Shawwal in their country based on the following and in the same order:Sighting the crescent of Shawwal due to the words of the Prophet [pbuh] who said, \"fast when you sight the crescent and end your fast when you sight it\", especially if they cannot sight the crescent clearly in their country.Following the sighting of the nearest Muslim country or the sighting of another close country where there are Muslims.If astronomers determine that it is the last day of Ramadan.The matter of sighting the crescent must not be a cause for controversy between Muslims to preserve their unity following the words of Allah,\"Obey God and His Messenger, and do not quarrel with one another, or you may lose heart and your spirit may desert you.\"[Qur`an 8:46]Allah Almighty knows best."

When she later inquired into the matter, some people advised her to fast two months consecutively, while others told her that only her husband is blameworthy. When some people advised her to feed sixty poor persons [in expiation], her husband refused to either pay or fast. She would like to know what she and her husband must do.",
    "Answer": "If the case is as mentioned in the question, the inquirer and her husband must make up the missed fast days by each fasting nine days instead. In addition to this, the husband must make expiation because he transgressed the limits ordained by Allah. It consists of fasting two consecutive months for each day he has missed. If unable to fast some or all the days, he is to feed sixty indigent persons of the average food he feeds his family for each day he is unable to fast.It has been reported in an authentic hadith that the Prophet ordered the man who approached him for the ruling for vitiating his fast in Ramadan by engaging in sexual intercourse with his wife to make expiation; the Prophet did not order his wife to do likewise. This was an incident that made it necessary to clarify the ruling since it is not permissible to delay the clarification of a matter beyond its time.

    "Answer": "It is established in Islamic law that a woman in her ‘idda [the period after divorce or the death of a husband] is not to adorn herself, use perfume or engage in any manifestations of joy. Moreover, during this time she must spend the night in the marital house. God Almighty says, “If any of you die and leave widows, the widows should wait for four months and ten nights before remarrying. When they have completed this set time, you will not be blamed for anything they may reasonably choose to do with themselves. God is fully aware of what you do” (Quran 2:234).It is permissible for a woman in her ‘idda to exit her house during the day or part of the night to run errands and fulfill her needs, but she should spend the night at home. Ibn Qudama said, \"A woman in her waiting period, whether a divorcee or a widow, may go out by day to fulfill her needs.\" Jabir reported that during her waiting period of a thrice pronounced divorce, his aunt [exited her house] to cut down her palm trees. When a man approached her and forbade her from doing so, she went to see the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and related the incident to him. He told her, “Go and cut down your palm trees for you may give out in charity from them or do [an act of] kindness” (al-Nisa`i and Abu Dawud). Mujahid narrated that after the battle of Uhud, the widows of the martyred men gathered in one house. They approached the Prophet and said, \"O Messenger of God! We get lonely at night so we spend the night at one house and return to our homes in the morning.\" The Prophet replied, \"Chat together at the house of one of you, but each is to return to her house when it is time to sleep\" (Sunan al-Baihaqi).The RulingIt is permissible for the inquirer to return to her job during her waiting period provided that she spends the night at the marital house"

    "Question": "it permissible for a woman to take medicine to prevent menstruation so as to be able to fast the [whole] of Ramadan?",
    "Answer": "Among the established rulings in Islamic law is that a Muslim woman must break her fast in Ramadan when she gets her monthly period due to the exhaustion and physiological disturbances associated with menstruation. For this reason, it is obligatory for a menstruating woman not to fast—it is a mercy from Allah Almighty.What some women do nowadays—eating very small amounts of food or drinking and then refraining from eating for the rest of the day—contravenes the wisdom behind relieving women from the obligation of fasting and preserving their physical and psychological health.A woman is required eat and drink when in her monthly period; she does not sin nor is she blameworthy because she will later make up the missed fast-days. as 'Aisha, the Mother of the Believers, said: \"When we were with the Prophet [pbuh] , we used to experience menstruation and were commanded to make up the [missed] fast-days but not prayers\" [Bukhari and Muslim]. Conditional permissibilityThere is no legal objection to taking medicine or pills to delay menstruation and allowing a woman to complete the fast-days of Ramadan without any interruptions. It is permissible for a woman to resort to such a practice on the condition that a physician determines that this will not harm her at any time. If it does, then it is unlawful to take medicine to delay menstruation because of the legal maxim which states; \"Do not harm and do not reciprocate harm\" and because the preservation of health is one of the exigencies of the objectives of Islamic law. Even though it is permissible for a woman to delay menstruation to fast Ramadan, it is better for her to abide by the commands of Allah Almighty and submit to His decree as this earns her a greater reward.Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to propose to woman during the waiting period of a revocable divorce?",
    "Answer": "According to scholarly consensus, it is established in Islamic law that it is prohibited to make an explicit marriage proposal to a woman observing her 'iddah (waiting period) after a revocable or irrevocable divorce or after the death of her husband. However, according to the Quran, it is permissible to make an allusive proposal. God the Almighty says, “You will not be blamed whether you give a hint that you wish to marry these women, or keep it to yourselves” (Quran 2:235).The words \"keep it to yourselves\" mean to refrain from disclosing the marriage offer either in an explicit or implicit manner. The word 'women' in this verse refers to those women observing their 'iddah of widowhood since it is to them that God refers in the verse preceding the above, “If any of you die and leave widows, the widows should wait for four months and ten nights before remarrying” (Quran 2:234).In their most apparent opinion, Shaf'i scholars permit making an allusive marriage proposal to a woman observing the 'iddah of a finalized divorce because the husband's authority to take back his wife has been severed, tantamount to the case of a woman in the 'iddah of widowhood.An allusive proposal is made using words that are not employed for marriage proposals, literally or figuratively, but which may indicate either a desire to marry or something else—it is the concatenation of circumstance that indicates the intent. Examples include \"God will grant you something good\", \"Who can find someone like you?\" and the like.Scholars have unanimously agreed that a person who proposes to a woman to whom it is unlawful to make an offer of marriage is blameworthy. However, a marriage contract based on such a proposal is valid according to the majority of scholars provided its integrals and conditions are met. A prohibited proposal does not affect the validity of the marriage contract because the proposal is not from among the integrals of marriage or the conditions for its validity.God the Almighty knows best."

On the other hand, is she to observe the same number of months as in the 'idda of a [non-pregnant] woman whose husband has died?",
    "Answer": "The 'idda (waiting period after divorce or the death of a husband) of a pregnant woman ends immediately after she gives birth whether she is widowed or divorced, provided the fetus is fully or partially formed. But if it is unformed, her 'idda does not end with delivery since the child is only considered a mudgha (lump of flesh) or 'alaqa (clot of congealed blood). God Almighty says, “The waiting period for those who are pregnant will be until they deliver their burden” (Quran 65:4). The general implication of this verse denotes both divorced and widowed women.Imam Ali and ibn 'Abbas (may God be pleased with them both) maintained that a woman is to calculate the period of her 'idda based on that which will occur last (the 'idda or giving birth). This opinion reconciles between the two Quranic verses,“The waiting period for those who are pregnant will be until they deliver their burden” (Quran 65:4) and “If any of you die and leave widows, the widows should wait for four months and ten days before remarrying” (Quran 2:234).The majority of scholars maintain a different opinion, substantiating it with the same evidence used by ibn Mas'ud in that the former verse was revealed after the latter.The RulingBased on the above, the 'idda of a pregnant widow terminates with childbirth.God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Salam,",
    "Answer": "It is permissible for a woman to travel without a mahram1 provided the way, destination and return journey are safe and provided she does not meet with any harassment jeopardizing both her safety and religion. It has been narrated through 'Adiy Ibn Hatem (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet told him, \"And if you live a long life, you will surely see women traveling from Hira till they circumambulate the Ka'ba, fearing no one except Allah\" [Bukhari and others]. Imam Ahmed's report of the hadith includes: \"By He in whose hands is my soul, verily Allah will bring this matter [Islam] into completion till women travel from Hira and circumambulate the Ka'ba without being accompanied by anyone.\"From this hadith with its different chains of narration, some scholars have derived the permissibility of a woman traveling alone if her safety is guaranteed. Moreover, they have used this hadith to restrict other prohibiting hadiths which, according to them, referred to the lack of security associated with travel in the distant past.The majority of scholars have permitted a woman to travel for obligatory hajj without a mahram if accompanied by trustworthy females or company. They based their opinion on the precedence of the Mothers of Believers (may Allah be pleased with them) who went on hajj after the Prophet's death and during the caliphate of 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) accompanied by 'Uthman ibn 'Affan (may Allah be pleased with him).Imam Abu al-Hasan Ibn Batal mentioned in Sharh Bukhari (vol. 4, p. 532), \"[Imams] Malik, al-Awza'i and al-Shafi'i said, 'A woman who does not have a mahram, may travel for her obligatory hajj with other women in trustworthy company; the majority of scholars permit this. Ibn 'Umar accompanied women from among his neighbors for hajj. This was the opinion of 'Ata`, Sa'id Ibn Jubair, Ibn Sirin and al-Hasan al-Basri who said that a Muslim man other than her mahram may even be more protective.\"Imam Al-Baji, the Maliki scholar, mentioned in Al-Muntaqa Sharh Al-Muwatta` (vol. 3, p. 95) that a woman's travel without a mahram is contingent upon the number of people accompanying her. It is impermissible for her to travel alone if she is with a small group of people. However, it is permissible for her to travel alone without a mahram if she is accompanied by a large number of people who guarantee her safety. This opinion was reported from al-Awza'i. The luminary Maliki scholar, Al-Hatab, mentioned in Mawahib Al-Jalil Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil (vol. 2, p. 523) that al-Baji restricted the permissibility of a woman traveling alone without a mahram in the case of a small group. Quoting Al-Baji, al-Hattab said that it is impermissible for a woman to travel alone if she is with a small group of people. However, it is permissible for her to travel alone without a mahram if she is accompanied by a large number of people who guarantee her safety. This opinion was reported in Al-Ikmal whose author did not mention any contesting opinions. It was likewise mentioned by al-Zanati in Sharh Al-Risala as the established opinion of the Maliki School, thereby restricting the opinions mentioned in Musannaf Khalil and other books.Al-Zanati said, \"It is agreed by the Malikis, including Malik himself, that it is permissible for a woman to travel without a mahram, whether for obligatory, recommended or permissible matters, if she is accompanied by a large group of reliable people, whose number is such that it is certain that she will be safe on her way and at her destination.\"The opinion appropriate for fatwa at present is that it is permissible and there is no objection to a woman traveling alone by the various safe routes and means of travel via their venues such as airports, harbors and the like. This applies whether she is traveling for something obligatory, recommended or permissible. The hadiths forbidding a woman to travel without a mahram pertain to lack of security which was the case in previous times. Based on this, if a woman's safety is ensured, the prohibition is lifted."

    "Question": "We have taken an orphan into our home. For three months, my wife fed him on her own expressed breast milk by using a breast pump. Does this make him a brother to my daughters and does this method of nursing establish a non-marriageable kinship with them?",
    "Answer": "The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, \"Suckling establishes prohibition in marriage in the same way as blood ties\" (Bukhari and Muslim).Elements of prohibited sucklingThe nursing woman must:- Be alive at the time the milk is extracted from her.- Is potentially able to give birth, whether she is a virgin, married, a divorcee, or a widow.States of breastmilk that establish milk kinshipBreastmilk may not necessarily remain in its [natural] state at the time it is expressed. Imam al-Nawawi, the Shafi'i scholar, stated in Rawdat al-Talibeen, \"If the state [of breastmilk] changes i.e. it goes sour, curdles, ferments, turns into cheese, butter, buttermilk or is mixed with bread, all of the above create an impediment to marriage because the milk reaches the stomach of the nursling and it is nourished on it. Mixing the milk with any other foodstuff similarly creates an impediment to marriage.\"It is not a condition that the milk reaches the infant's stomach in any one single manner; the feedings may include suckling the infant, pouring the milk into his mouth [with no act of sucking] or into his nose. [The important thing] is the number of feedings which establish milk kinship.To establish prohibition, the milk must reach the stomach of a live infant whether through the act of suckling or pouring the expressed milk into its mouth until it reaches the stomach. As for the infant’s age, it must not exceed two lunar years. They are calculated starting from the day the child was born.The RulingIf the infant mentioned in the question has consumed your wife's breastmilk five times or more during the first two years of its life, then the child is your son through nursing and a brother through nursing to your daughters. He cannot marry any of your daughters because the milk kinship establishes prohibition to marriage. It is permissible for him to mix [freely] with them as a full brother.And God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "I would like a clarification of the legal ruling for istihada and whether, during this time, a woman may observe the legal obligations required of her.",
    "Answer": "A woman may be in a state of: 1. Purity (not menstruating).2. Menstruation (experiencing menstruation during its regular time and conditions).3. Istihada (bleeding that exceeds the normal duration of a woman's menstrual cycle and whose characteristics are different from menstrual bleeding).4. Dysfunctional bleeding such as premenarchal bleeding.The distinguishing factor between menstrual blood and the blood of istihada is the time of its occurrence and its characteristic features.Evidence from the sunnah- Describing menstrual blood, the Prophetsaid, \"Menstrual blood is black and odorous. If it is this [kind of] blood, do not pray and if it is another, perform ablution and pray\" [Narrated by Fatima Bint Hubaysh through 'A`isha].- The Prophetsaid, \"Menstrual blood is thick and reddish-black while the blood of istihada is yellow and thin\" [Recorded by Al-Darqatni, al-Baihaqi and al-Tabarani from a raised chain hadith narrated by Abu Umama].- In another version of the hadith, hesaid, \"Menstrual blood is always thick and reddish and non-menstrual blood is always thin and yellowish.\"- \"If it is menstrual blood, it is recognized from its dark color and you must refrain from praying. If it is another, perform ablution as it is venous bleeding\" [Recorded by Al-Nisa`i and Abu Dawud from a raised chain hadith narrated by 'A`isha].Scholarly opinions- Ibn 'Abbas said, \"As for the woman who sees blood that is intense red, she must abstain from praying.\" He further said, \"By Allah! A woman will see the color of blood after her menstrual cycle as the color of water after rinsing meat.\"- Imam Al-Nawawi described the color of menstrual blood as black i.e dark red that is almost black. Al-Qani` is very dark red blood but that is not as dark as that described in the hadith mentioning black menstrual blood. Rather, it refers to very dark red blood that is almost black due to the concentration of the red color. - Scholars are unanimous that a woman in a state of istihada is to perform a fresh ablution at the time of each obligatory prayer and any voluntary prayers she may wish to pray.- Some scholars permit a woman to perform her missed prayers with the same ablution. She may also touch and carry the mus-haf (copy of the Qur`an) and make the prostration of recitation or gratitude.- She is obliged to pray and fast and observe any other obligatory act of worship upon which purity is contingent.- Ibn Jarir cited the scholars' unanimous agreement on the permissibility of a woman in a state of istihada to recite the Qur`an.- Ibrahim Al-Nakh'i reported that a woman experiencing istihada is not to touch the mus-haf and this is likewise the opinion of Abu Hanifa and the preponderant opinion of his school. They have likewise maintained that she is not to touch anything containing one complete Qur`anic verse.- The ablution of a woman in a state of istihada becomes invalid when the time of the prayer for which she performed it elapses. If, for instance, she performed ablution for the noon prayer during its time, she is not to pray the mid-afternoon prayer with the same ablution. Apart from the reasons which require her to repeat the ablution, she must repeat the ablution when the time of the mid-afternoon prayer enters.The rulingWe are inclined to favor the opinion of those who maintain that a when a woman in a state of istihada has made ablution for a particular obligatory prayer, it is permissible for her to perform all acts of worship that are permissible for a person in a state of ablution. These include reciting the Qur`an, touching and carrying the mus-haf, praying voluntary prayers and making the prostration of recitation and gratitude.Allah the Almighty knows best."

After it became regular once again, I would find a reddish discharge once or twice in a single day or every other day after I assumed it has ended. This continues until the 10th-12th day of my period",
    "Answer": "The menstrual periodIt is the periodic blood that flows from a woman at times other than post-natal bleeding. It is dark colored and pungent smelling. Yellow or dusky colored discharge is considered menstrual flow. This is based on the hadith narrated by 'Alqama ibn abu 'Alqama through his mother, the servant of 'Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her who said: \"Women would send 'A`isha small boxes containing yellow stained cotton, and she would tell them, 'Do not be hasty until you see the cotton pure and white' \" [Reported by Malik. Bukhari declared it mu'allaq].This means that the piece of cotton must be white and not yellow stained.The length of the menstrual period- The minimum period is a single day and night- The maximum period is 15 days- The usual period is 6-7 days.The RulingThe discharge, exiting once or twice on the same day and which continues until the 12th day of the inquirer's period, is considered menstrual flow.

    "Question": "A fight broke out between the families of Ghazala and Mekkawi. During the fight, a woman from the Ghazali family was shot by a man from the rival family and died a few days later in the hospital. Consequently, her children killed her murderer and the matter was thus settled in 1986. The questions are:",
    "Answer": "Allah the Almighty prescribed retribution to deter a would-be murderer from threatening the life of others, encroaching upon their rights and security, and spreading corruption and chaos upon the earth. Without retribution, the consequence of murder would inevitably be moral collapse, a disturbance in the essence of the social structure and a distrust in Divine legislation to provide peace and security on earth which man has been commanded to administer and on which he has been enjoined to implement the prescribed legal penalties. Allah the Almighty says,In the Law of Equality there is (saving of life) to you. O ye men of understandingthat ye may restrain yourselves. [Al-Baqarah, 179]Several means for saving lives can be deduced from the above verse, such as:- Lives are saved by deterring the culprit from committing the crime in the first place. Whoever knows for certain that he will pay the price of his crime with his life, will surely pause to reflect and hesitate before committing it.- In the case of murder, if the victim's relatives choose to remit the punishment, a life will be saved by their good will and unwillingness to submit to hatred and a desire for revenge. Revenge knew no bounds among the tribes of Arabia who waged intermittent battles sometimes for as long as forty years such as the well known war of Basus. Similarly at our present times, family feuds and hostilities leading to massacres continue for generations.- Lives are saved in a general and more inclusive sense. Taking the life of one person is tantamount to taking the life of the whole people. If the threat of retribution deters the offender from spilling the blood of a single person, then it is as if he is deterred from killing the whole people. This is therefore equivalent to saving life in its general sense and not merely that of a single person, family, or community.Retribution is not prescribed for merely any kind of killing, but only for intentional murder and under certain conditions laid down by scholars.The ruling1- The life of a man for a woman; this is the opinion of the majority of scholars whohave based their opinion on the words of Allah the Almighty Who says,We ordained therein for them: \"Life for a life.\" [Al-Ma`ida: 45]In the Law of Equality there is (saving of) life to you. O ye men of understanding; that ye may restrain yourselves.[Al-Baqarah: 179]The rulings encoded in the above verses are general unless there is textual evidence to restrict them and due to the report of Abu Bakr Ibn Mohammed Ibn Amr Ibn Hazm who narrated from his father through his grandfather who said, \"The Messenger of Allah wrote a letter to the people of Yemen which included, \"The life of a man for a woman\" [Recorded by 'Abdul-Razzaq, al-Daraqutni and others]. Since both a man and a woman receive the same punishment for accusing another of adultery if they do not produce any witnesses (qadhf), the law of retaliation would apply to both genders without discrimination.2- No one may exact retribution himself but must defer the matter to the concerned court to fulfill its conditions.3- Nothing has been mentioned in either the primary texts nor indicated by the practice of our pious predecessors concerning the permissibility of exchanging shrouds between rival families. It is a novel custom indicating a truce. As such, there is no objection to it in Islamic law.Retaliation is waived when one of the following occurs:• The victim's family or one of them (provided he is an adult and sane) pardons the offender;• The offender dies before retribution is exacted against him.Waiving retribution renders the payment of blood money obligatory except if the victim's family forgo their right to it.Allah the Almighty knows best"

    "Question": "Is it permissible for a person who constantly travels due to the nature of his work to refrain from fasting?",
    "Answer": "The dispensation for a traveler to break his fast Allah Almighty permits a person who is traveling to break his fast on the following conditions:- The distance of the journey is not less than 83.5 km - The purpose of the journey must not be an act of disobedience. A legal ruling is determined according to the presence or absence of its cause The Shari'ah made travel a legitimate reason to miss one's fasts, irrespective of the hardship that is usually associated with traveling. Therefore, it is valid to consider traveling itself a manifest and regulated cause ['illa] upon which to base the ruling. A ruling is dependent upon the presence or absence of its cause. Therefore, a person who is traveling is granted the dispensation to miss his fast. As for the hardship associated with travel, it is unregulated because it differs from one person to another, and therefore it is not valid to base a ruling on it. For this reason, the ruling for the permissibility of breaking one's fast while traveling is not contingent upon the presence or absence of hardship.Allah Almighty says, And anyone who is ill or on a journey should make up for the missed days by fasting on other days later. Allah wants ease for you, not hardship.[Qur'an 2: 185]So when a fasting person is traveling, as long as the purpose of the journey is not to disobey Allah, it is permissible for the traveler to break his fast whether or not his journey involves hardship or the travel is constant. This dispensation is applicable even if his constant traveling is a result of work-related responsibilities.It is better to fast Allah Almighty made it clear that, in spite of the dispensation to miss one's fast, it is better for a person who is traveling to fast. He says:And fasting is better for you. [Qur'an 2:184]It is better for a person who is traveling to fast as long as fasting does not pose a difficulty for him and he will be rewarded abundantly. This is because fasting during Ramadan, for those who are able to, outweighs fasting at any other time. If a traveler believes that fasting may harm him, it is disliked for him to fast and if he fears death, it is obligatory for him to break his fast.Allah Almighty knows best."

We boarded the plane at 1:00 p.m and broke our fast according to the Egyptian local time. However, the problem is that we broke our fast while the sun was still high in the sky and did not set except towards the end of the journey i.e. after 10 hours.",
    "Answer": "It is permissible for a person traveling by plane to break his fast when the sun sets at his location. He is not to break his fast according to the [local] time of the country of his departure or that which he is flying over but when he sees that the whole disk of the sun has set. If it becomes difficult for the traveler to continue his fast, he is to break it due to the excessive hardship posed by travel and not because the fasting hours have ended; and he must make up the day on which he broke his fast. The in-flight announcements made by some pilots concerning breaking the fast according to the local time of the country of departure or the plane's current location without giving heed to seeing the sun set is legally invalid. A fasting person is to break his fast when the sun first sets and is to ignore its subsequent appearances and disappearances which occur due to the plane's speed. Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to fast the missed fast-days of Ramadan and the voluntary six days of Shawwal with a single intention?",
    "Answer": "Many jurists have maintained that it is permissible to subsume a voluntary fast under the intention of an obligatory one, but not vice-versa.Based on this, it is permissible for a Muslim woman to make up what she has missed of Ramadan during the month of Shawwal. Making up the missed fast-days of Ramadan suffices her for the six days of Shawwal and she obtains their reward since her fast took place during Shawwal. This is analogous to the case of one who enters a mosque and, before sitting down, offers two rak'as with the intention of praying either an obligatory or voluntary prayer by which he obtains the reward of performing the two rak'as of greeting the mosque [Tahiyat-ul-Masjid]. This is because he offered the two rak'as before sitting down. In his meta-commentary, al-Buayrmi stated that the reward is obtained through offering two or more rak'as, whether the prayer was obligatory or another voluntary prayer and whether [the prayer for greeting the mosque] was intended or not because of the words of the Prophet who said, \"Whoever enters a mosque should not sit before performing two rak'as\" [Bukhari and Muslim].The hadith denotes that the prayer must be offered before sitting down and this has occurred.Concerning the issue of fasting, Al-Suyuti stated in Al-Ashbah wa Al-Nadha`ir [p. 22]: \"If, for instance, a person fasts on the day of 'Arafa in fulfillment of a make up fast, a vow or expiation, and at the same time makes the intention to fast the day of 'Arafa, his fast is valid according to al-Barzi and he fulfills both fasts.\" He continued, \"The same is true for an undesignated fast by analogy to the case of the prayer for greeting the mosque.\"It must be noted that, in this case, the reward obtained is for fulfilling the sunnah of fasting six days during the month of Shawwal though a person will not earn the full reward (tantamount to fasting for an entire year). Al-Ramli wrote in Nihayat Al- Muhtaj (vol. 3, p. 208-9): \"If a person observes a makeup fast, a vow or another voluntary fast in Shawwal or if he observes a make up fast on a day such as 'Ashura, he attains the reward of the voluntary fast as my father (Shihab ad-Deen Ahmed ar-Ramli)-may Allah grant him mercy-maintained following the opinion of Barzi, al-Asfuni, al Nashiri, the scholar Ali ibn Salih al-Hadrimi and others, though he will not earn the full reward.\" Allah the Almighty knows best."

This is the highest degree of fasting. Imam al-Ghazali described the three degrees of fasting as follows:1- The fast of the ordinary person: It consists of abstaining from food and drink and sexual gratification.2- The fast of the select few: It consists of keeping the ears, eyes, tongue, hands, feet and all other organs free of sin.3- The fast of the elite: It consists of the abstention of the heart from worldly thoughts and worries or preoccupation with anything other than Allah Almighty."

The cannon signaling the approach of dawn is usually fired 15 to 20 minutes before dawn as a precautionary measure. Between sunset and the arrival of dawn, it is permissible for a person who intends to fast to eat, drink, and do anything that is permissible for a non-fasting person. When dawn breaks, a person must abstain from eating and drinking; he must spit out any food in his mouth, because the fasting hours start at the break of dawn. Imam Bukhari reported in his Sahih that the Prophet [(peace and blessings be upon him) instructed his Companions, may God be pleased with them, to continue eating and drinking until ibn Um Maktum makes the call for Dawn Prayers (when the break of dawn has been confirmed).

    "Answer": "If a Muslim engages in sexual intercourse with his wife during the fasting hours in Ramadan, his fast is invalidated and he is obliged to make it up in addition to making expiation.Textual EvidenceA man came to the Prophet [pbuh] and said, \"I am ruined!\"\"Why?\" asked the Prophet. He replied, \"I engaged in intercourse with my wife while I was fasting (in the month of Ramadan).\" The Prophet asked, \"Do you have enough money to free a slave?\"\"No,\" replied the man. The Prophet asked, \"Can you fast two months consecutively?\"\"No,\" replied the man.The Prophet asked, \"Can you afford to feed sixty poor persons?\"[Again] the man said, \"No.\"The man then sat down whereupon a basketful of dates was brought to the Prophet. He said, \"Take this and give it out as expiation.\"The man said, \"There is none in Medina more in need of this than me.\"The Prophet smiled and said, \"Go and give it to your family.\"Upon whom is expiation obligatory?Many scholars maintain that expiation in this case is obligatory upon the husband only because he engaged in sexual intercourse while remembering he is fasting. The expiation is paid in the same sequence mentioned in the above hadith. It consists of:• Freeing a slave.• If not possible, fasting the days of two months consecutively.• If not possible, feeding sixty poor persons on a scale of the average of what he provides for his family."

    "Question": "What is the extent of the legality for fasting six days of Shawwal (the six 'white' days) and what is their reward?Is it permissible to combine the intention of fasting them with the intention of making up the missed fast days of Ramadan?Is it a condition to fast them consecutively?",
    "Answer": "The merit of fasting six days of Shawwal Abu Ayub al-Ansari narrated that the Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Whoever fasts Ramadan and follows it with six days of Shawwal is as though he has fasted the entire year\" [Reported by Muslim in his Sahih]. According to the opinion of many scholars, it is commendable to fast these days. Since Allah rewards each good deed with ten times its value, a Muslim who fasts six days of Shawwal after the fast of Ramadan is considered to have fasted 360 days i.e. an entire year.Scholars noticed that the relationship of fasting the six days of Shawwal to Ramadan is analogous to that of the voluntary prayers following obligatory prayers and that the relationship of fasting days from Sha'ban is analogous to that of the voluntary prayers preceding the obligatory prayers—they fill the imperfections that may have occurred in an obligatory action. Moreover, they indicate that the fast of Ramadan has been accepted by the will of Allah. This is because among the signs that an act of worship has been accepted, is following it up with another act of worship. Additionally, it shows that a person does not become bored of obedience and thus sets out to fast yet again after breaking his fast on the Day of 'Eid, the Day of Reward.Manner of fastingIt is not a condition to fast the six days of Shawwal consecutively. For instance, a person can distribute them over the month of Shawwal by fasting on Mondays and Thursdays or on the three white days i.e. the 13th, 14th and 15th of a lunar month. However, it is best to perform them immediately after the day of 'Eid.Making up the missed fast days of RamadanIf possible, it is preferable to make up the missed fast days of Ramadan before fasting the six days of Shawwal. This is due to the hadith that states, \"A debt owed to Allah has more right to be fulfilled.\"According to Shafi'i scholars, it is possible to combine the intention of making up the missed fast days of Ramadan with the six days of Shawwal. Alternatively, one can fast the six days of Shawwal first and delay making up the missed fast days of Ramadan provided one completes them before the next Ramadan.The time for making the intentionThe intention of fasting the six days of Shawwal can be made any time before noon provided one has not done anything that voids fasting. Such is the case for all voluntary fasts, in contrast to obligatory and make up fasts for which one must make the intentionbefore dawn.Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Is it necessary to make the intention for fasting for each day of Ramadan or does it suffice to make a single intention for the entire month?",
    "Answer": "The importance of intentions Islam attaches great importance to intentions since they determine the purpose of man and his direction in various matters. The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Actions are [judged] according to intentions and each person will be rewarded accordingly. So he whose emigration was for the sake of Allah and His Messenger, then his emigration was for the sake of Allah and His Messenger and he whose emigration was for the sake of some worldly gain or a woman he desired to marry, then his emigrations was for that for which he emigrated.\"The intention for fastingThe Messenger of Allah said, \"He who does not make the intention for fasting before dawn, there is no fast for him\" i.e. it is not necessary to utter the intention for each fast day, but to resolve in his heart that he will fast the following day.Scholarly opinionsScholars differed on whether making the intention to fast Ramadan is a pillar or condition. Some scholars maintained that the intention must be made during the night before dawn and renewed for each fast day of Ramadan. They also maintained that a person must be specific when formulating his intention for an obligatory fast and say, \"I intent to fast tomorrow [a day from] the month of Ramadan.\"Another group of scholars maintained that it suffices for a person to resolve in his heart that he will fast the following day. According to them, the time for making the intention extends from sunset till before noon. Therefore, a person who forgets to make the intention during the night is to make it any time before noon such that the remaining part of the day is greater than the former. Maliki scholars maintained that it suffices to make a single intention for a consecutive fast such as Ramadan.The rulingIt can be concluded from the above that the principle and better course of action is to make the intention for each fast day if possible. But if a person fears forgetfulness, he is to make the intention for the current performance of the Ramadan fast for the sake of Allah on the eve of the first night of Ramadan.

    "Question": "A friend of mine told me that his parents married in Ramadan. His father believed wrongly that fasting was not obligatory for him and his wife as long since they were newlyweds. Accordingly, they did not fast the entire Ramadan in which they got married. The mother stated she made up the days owed, but the father died before doing so. The question is: can the son make up the missed days on behalf of his father? Are there any other requirements?",
    "Answer": "Assuming that the man mentioned broke his fast by eating and drinking, and made no intention to fast out of his mistaken belief that he did not need to because he was a newlywed: the ruling in this case is that one must make up the missed days, though an atonement is not necessary. It is true that he necessarily had sexual intercourse with his wife but he did not make the intention to fast to start with.His son must feed a poor person for each missed day of fasting. This means that he has to feed 30 poor persons on behalf of his father.And Allah Most High knows best."

    "Question": "We heard that some soccer players refrain from fasting in Ramadan because of the physical exertion they experience during games or training sessions that take place during the month. What is the ruling on this?",
    "Answer": "A player under a contract with a club is considered a hired worker who is obligated to perform his work. It is permissible for such a person to take the dispensation to refrain from fasting if the work under the terms of the contract is his source of livelihood, it is necessary for him to participate in a game during Ramadan and it is most likely that fasting will affect his performance.Scholars have maintained that it is permissible for a hired worker or one who performs strenuous work to refrain from fasting if the fast will weaken him and adversely affect his work. In the Hanafi School it is permissible for a person who is hired for a determined period — as in the case of professional soccer players under contract — and whose work is affected by his fast, to refrain from fasting even if he possesses sufficient wealth.Scholarly opinionsIbn AbdinThe Hanafi scholar, Ibn Abdin, wrote in his commentary Rad al-Muhtar 'ala Ad-Dur Al-Mukhtar (2/420) that:It is impermissible for a worker to refrain from fasting if he possesses whatsuffices him and his dependants in analogy to the impermissibility of begging when a person has sufficient means for a living.It is permissible for him to work only to the extent of fulfilling his needs if he does not possess sufficient funds. It is permissible for him to refrain from fasting if his work conditions compel him to break his fast and he cannot find another job that enables him to work while fasting. It is also permissible for crop owners to refrain from fasting if they fear damage to or theft of their crops, they cannot find someone to harvest the crops for typical wages and are able to do the job themselves. This is based on the permissibility of interrupting prayers for less significant reasons.If a worker is hired for a known period that coincides with the month of Ramadan, the apparent ruling [in the school] is that it is permissible for him to refrain from fasting even if he possesses what suffices him if his employer declines to revoke the contract.This is based on the analogy to a wet nurse who is obliged to continue nursing the child for the agreed upon period; it is permissible for her to refrain from fasting if she fears for the child's health were she to continue fasting. If this is so, then it is only with greater reason that a worker fears for his own health.Al-Hattab, the Maliki scholar Citing Al-Barazly in Mawahib al-Jalil Sharh Mukhtasr Khalil (2/441) Al-Hattab said:The ruling for exposure to flax dust, coal dust and dust generated in barley and wheat stores [while fasting] is the same as that for exposure to gypsum dust. He posited the question whether it is permissible for a worker who has been hired to harvest crops to refrain from fasting if Ramadan coincides with summer. He opined that it is permissible if the work is indispensible for his livelihood, otherwise it is disliked. There is no contention over the permissibility of a crop owner reaping his own harvest even if he would have to break his fast or else he would commit the prohibition of wasting his property.It is generally permissible for a woman who spins linen and thins threads with her mouth to fast when working with Egyptian linen. But, if her work involves thinning thread which leaves an aftertaste in her mouth, then the ruling for her is the same as that for workers of other industries: her work is permissible [while fasting] if she is compelled to work [due to financial need]. Otherwise, it is considered disliked.Ibn Hajr al-Haitami, the Shafi'i scholar In Tuhfat al-Muhtaj (3/429-430), he wrote:It is permissible for the sick to refrain from fasting Ramadan and any other obligatory fast [such as a votive fast] … (and) it is permissible for a person to refrain from fasting on account of harvesting or building for himself or for another, either voluntarily or for a fee, (even if the work can be executed by another). This is similar to the ruling for a wet nurse for whom it is permissible to refrain from fasting i.e. if he fears that fasting would affect his income, it is not possible to work at night or the work executed at night does not suffice to protect the crops from damage or from sustaining a manifest deficiency. This is the apparent meaning of the opinion of Shafi'i scholars …Commenting on the above, Shaykh Abdul Hamid al-Sherwani wrote concerning Ibn Hajar's words, 'it is permissible to refrain from fasting on account of harvesting and the like …' , that Al-Adhru'i issued a legal opinion to the effect that, every night during Ramadan, crop harvesters must make the intention to fast. He then added that whoever from among them finds that fasting under harsh circumstances poses severe hardship, may break his fast; otherwise, he is not to. In addition to this, it has been mentioned in Al-I'ab that it is obvious that the ruling for any kind of strenuous work is the same as that for crop harvesters. The general nature of the ruling does not distinguish between an owner, an employee who has sufficient means and a volunteer. The generalization is the same as the ruling for a wet nurse, whether hired or a volunteer, even if she is not the only accessible nurse. However, it is necessary to limit this concession by certain contingencies such as a need for a particular kind of work when a person fears severe financial losses were he to refrain from working during the daylight hours.Soccer gamesIt is permissible for a player to refrain from fasting during Ramadan in games in which the player’s performance is affected by fasting."

    "Question": "Asalamu alykum,I am a mother of 3, two boys and one girl and we live in Canada. I am aware that Muslim women are not allowed to marry anyone but a Muslim man. In the Qura'n 'AL BAQARA' # 221' Forbids marriage from polytheists for both men and women.",
    "Answer": "This is mentioned in the words of God Almighty, which can be translated as:This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage are] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers. (Al-Ma'idah, 5).In this noble verse, God Almighty only allowed Muslims to feed the non-Muslims from their foods. This way God draws Muslims attention to the fact that the matter of eating slaughtered animals differs from marriage, since it is allowed for Muslims to eat the meat slaughtered by the People of the Book and vice-versa. On the contrary, it is only permissible for Muslim men to marry women from the people of the Book and not the other way round. Hence, it is impermissible for a non-Muslim man to marry a Muslim woman. If non-Muslim men were allowed to marry Muslim women, they will have a legal authority over them and God never allows non-Muslims to have authority over Muslims. Unlike food, it is allowed to exchange food with non-Muslims since there are no legal restrictions on it in Islamic law.Interfaith Marriages in IslamIt is permissible in Islam for a Muslim man to marry a non-Muslim woman (Christian or Jewish) and not vice-versa. Though this may seem unfair, the rationale behind it becomes clear if the true reason is known.All legislations in Islam are based upon certain wisdom and a definite interest to all parties involved.Marriage in Islam is based upon love, mercy and peace of mind; a family must be built upon a firm basis to guarantee the continuity of the marital relationship. Islam respects all the previous heavenly revealed religions and the belief in all the previous Prophets is an inseparable part of the Islamic creed.A Muslim man who marries a Christian or a Jewish woman, is commanded to respect her faith, and it is not permissible for him to prevent his wife from practicing the rites of her religion and going to the church or synagogue. Therefore, Islam seeks to provide the wife with her husband's respect for her religion which in turn protects the family from destruction.On the other hand, a non-Muslim man will not respect his Muslim wife's faith. This is because a Muslim man believes in all previous religions and Prophets of God and respects them while a non-Muslim does not believe nor acknowledges the Prophet of Islam; rather, a non-Muslim considers Prophet Mohammed a false prophet and usually believes in all the fabricated lies made against Islam and its Prophet. Even if a non-Muslim husband does not explicitly express this, a Muslim wife will constantly feel that her husband does not respect her faith. There is no room for compliments regarding this matter; it is a matter of principle. Moreover, mutual respect between spouses is a fundamental element for the continuity of their marital relationship.Islam follows its own logic when it prohibits a Muslim man from marrying a non-Muslim other than a Christian or a Jewess for the same reason it prohibits a Muslim woman from marrying a non-Muslim.A Muslim believes in only the Heavenly revealed religions; all other religions are human made. So, in the case when a Muslim woman marries a non-Muslim, the element of respect to the wife's religion will be non-existent. This will affect the marital relationship and will not achieve the love and mercy that is required in a marital relationship."

    "Question": "I don't wear the hijab. Will Allah accept my prayers and fast?",
    "Answer": "Hijab, the legal attire of a Muslim woman is a duty imposed by Allah the Almighty. He prohibited her from exposing those parts of her body which she has been commanded to conceal from men who are not of her unmarriageable kin. The legal attire is that which conceals the entire body except the face and hands; it must not be revealing, transparent or cling to the body.All legal duties must be observedThe various legal duties are not interchangeable. For instance, it is impermissible for one who performs prayers to forsake fasting. Similarly, praying and fasting do not justify that a woman neglect wearing the legal attire.A Muslim woman who prays and fasts but does not wear the legal attire which Allah commanded her to wear is blameless with regards to her fast and prayers but blameworthy for not wearing the hijab which is obligatory. Whether Allah will accept her fast and prayers is a matter that is left to Allah the Almighty; a Muslim is obliged to think the best of Allah the Glorious even if he or she has sinned or disobeyed Him. Allah is most MercifulA Muslim must know that one of the many kinds of mercies that Allah extends to man, is His decree that good deeds erase the bad and not vice-versa. A Muslim must also open a new page with Allah, repent from any sins and make the month of Ramadan the starting point for embarking on good deeds that would lead him to Allah the Almighty and earn His favor.A Muslim woman, upon who Allah has bestowed the gift of prayers, fasting during Ramadan and obedience to Him must show gratitude by performing the duties she has neglected. This is because one of the signs that a good deed has been accepted is being conferred the success of following up that good deed with another.Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to fast the missed fast-days of Ramadan and the voluntary six days of Shawwal with a single intention?",
    "Answer": "Many jurists have maintained that it is permissible to subsume a voluntary fast under the intention of an obligatory one, but not vice-versa.Based on this, it is permissible for a Muslim woman to make up what she has missed of Ramadan during the month of Shawwal. Making up the missed fast-days of Ramadan suffices her for the six days of Shawwal and she obtains their reward since her fast took place during Shawwal. This is analogous to the case of one who enters a mosque and, before sitting down, offers two rak'as with the intention of praying either an obligatory or voluntary prayer by which he obtains the reward of performing the two rak'as of greeting the mosque [Tahiyat-ul-Masjid]. This is because he offered the two rak'as before sitting down. In his meta-commentary, al-Buayrmi stated that the reward is obtained through offering two or more rak'as, whether the prayer was obligatory or another voluntary prayer and whether [the prayer for greeting the mosque] was intended or not because of the words of the Prophet who said, \"Whoever enters a mosque should not sit before performing two rak'as\" [Bukhari and Muslim]. The hadith denotes that the prayer must be offered before sitting down and this has occurred.Concerning the issue of fasting, Al-Suyuti stated in Al-Ashbah wa Al-Nadha`ir [p. 22]: \"If, for instance, a person fasts on the day of 'Arafa in fulfillment of a make up fast, a vow or expiation, and at the same time makes the intention to fast the day of 'Arafa, his fast is valid according to al-Barzi and he fulfills both fasts.\" He continued, \"The same is true for an undesignated fast by analogy to the case of the prayer for greeting the mosque.\"It must be noted that, in this case, the reward obtained is for fulfilling the sunnah of fasting six days during the month of Shawwal though a person will not earn the full reward (tantamount to fasting for an entire year). Al-Ramli wrote in Nihayat Al- Muhtaj (vol. 3, p. 208-9): \"If a person observes a makeup fast, a vow or another voluntary fast in Shawwal or if he observes a make up fast on a day such as 'Ashura, he attains the reward of the voluntary fast as my father (Shihab ad-Deen Ahmed ar-Ramli)-may Allah grant him mercy-maintained following the opinion of Barzi, al-Asfuni, al Nashiri, the scholar Ali ibn Salih al-Hadrimi and others, though he will not earn the full reward.\""

    "Question": "Is fasting accepted from one who does not pray?",
    "Answer": "One should never leave the prayer as God and the Prophet have made this clear. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “The covenant that is between us and them is prayer. Whoever has left the prayer has left Islam.” Also one does not want to fall into the words of God, “Then is it only a part of the Book that you believe in, and do you reject the rest? But what is the reward for those among you who behave like this but disgrace in this life.”As for the issue of fasting being accepted or not, the scholars do not talk about it as the issue is left to God. We hope that God accepts the fast of all those who fast, even if the one who prays has a better chance of their fast being accepted than the one who does not.Prayer is not one of the conditions for the validity of fasting. However, leaving prayer is a major sin and it is not permissible for a Muslim to do this. Whoever amongst the Muslims has left their prayers must return to God with sincere repentance.And God Almighty knows best.http://eng.dar-alifta.org/foreign/ViewFatwa.aspx?ID=6188"

    "Question": "Is it permissible for women to make up their fasting days that she missed because of her menstrual period during the six days of Shawwal and have the reward for the six days of Shawwal?",
    "Answer": "According to many of the jurists it is permissible to couple extra fasting days with canonical days of fast and not the other way around, meaning it is not permissible to couple the intention to fast a canonical fast with an intention to fast an extra day. By way of example Imam al-Ramli has commented on Imam al-Nawawi’s Minhaj by saying:It is stated in the commentary of al-Muhadhab that if one prays more than two units of prayer [in praying the sunna two units for greeting a mosque] with one salutations it is permissible as all of them [units of prayer] are the prayer of greeting the mosque as they contain the two units.Praying the greeting prayer of the mosque can be achieved by either a canonical prayer or another supererogatory prayer,’ whether one has made an intention for this or not as what is sought is a prayer before sitting, and this is achieved with what has been mentioned. The intention for the greeting prayer does not invalidate this prayer as it is a sunnah which is not intended, contrary to the intention of the canonical prayer alongside with the intention for a supererogatory prayer which is not valid.” As for the specific question posed above, the jurists of the Shafi’i School are of the opinion that whoever makes up missed days of Ramadan during the six days of Shawwal, they have fulfilled their religious obligation as well as gaining the reward for the six extra days of fast during Shawwal. However, one should not intend to fast the six days of Shawwal, rather they should intend only to make up what they missed from Ramadan, and since these make up days will fall during the six days of Shawwal the reward of the sunnah fast is gained as well. Indeed the generosity of God is vast. This opinion is based on the hadith of the Prophet, “Whoever fasts Ramadan and follows it with six days from the month of Shawwal, it is as if they have fasted the entire year.” He did not mention that these six days need a specific intention; rather he talked about Ramadan being followed in general by six days from Shawwal. These six days can be achieved by intending a sunnah fast or to make up days missed in Ramadan.Imam al-Ramli issued a fatwa stating this position, “the person making up missed days from Ramadan in Shawwal, even if he has intended other than the fast of Shawwal has also gained the reward for the six days of Shawwal. This issue has been mentioned by many of the later jurists.” Based on this it is permissible for a woman to make up her missed days of Ramadan during Shawwal and achieve the reward for fasting six days of Shawwal. This is in accordance with what has been mentioned and based on the permissibility of someone entering a mosque and praying two units of prayer intending that they be canonical prayers, or sunnah prayers, and achieve the greeting of the mosque prayer. God is most high all knowledgeable."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to fast based on the sighting of the new moon in a country other than the country in which one currently is?",
    "Answer": "The residents of a given country should not begin or end their fast based on a moon sighting that differs from that of the country where they reside because this inconsistency divides the unity of Muslims and sows discord and division among them. Furthermore, it is established in Islamic law that the person charged with the affairs of Muslims dispels any disagreement that occurs between people. Accordingly, if a fatwa is issued stating that the new moon of Ramadan, or any other month for that matter, has been sighted in a given country, it is incumbent upon the Muslims in that country to adhere to that fatwa. It is not permissible for them to disregard it. This is due to the narration according to Karib that Um al-Fadl bint al-Harith sent him to Mu’awiyah in the Levant. He said, “Ramadan started when I arrived in the Levant. I saw the new moon on Friday. Then I arrived in Medina at the end of the month. ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Abbas questioned me and mentioned the new moon. “When did you sight the new moon?” he asked. “We saw it on Friday night,” I told him. “Did you see it?” he asked. “Yes,” I said. “The people sighted it and fasted, and Mu’awiyah fasted.” “But we saw it on Saturday night,” he said, “And we will continue to fast until we complete thirty days or see the new moon.” “Are you not satisfied with the sighting and fasting of Mu’awiyah?” I asked. “No,” he said. “This is what the Messenger of God commanded us to do.” Therefore, the hadith indicates that every country should follow its own sighting, and this is the position we adopt for fatwa. And God is Most High and Knows Best."

    "Question": "Is it necessary to make the intention for fasting for each day of Ramadan or does it suffice to make a single intention for the entire month?",
    "Answer": "Islam attaches great importance to intentions since they determine the purpose of man and his direction in various matters. The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Actions are [judged] according to intentions and each person will be rewarded accordingly. So he whose emigration was for the sake of Allah and His Messenger, then his emigration was for the sake of Allah and His Messenger and he whose emigration was for the sake of some worldly gain or a woman he desired to marry, then his emigrations was for that for which he emigrated.\"The intention for fastingThe Messenger of Allah said, \"He who does not make the intention for fasting before dawn, there is no fast for him\" i.e. it is not necessary to utter the intention for each fast day, but to resolve in his heart that he will fast the following day.Scholarly opinionsScholars differed on whether making the intention to fast Ramadan is a pillar or condition. Some scholars maintained that the intention must be made during the night before dawn and renewed for each fast day of Ramadan. They also maintained that a person must be specific when formulating his intention for an obligatory fast and say, \"I intent to fast tomorrow [a day from] the month of Ramadan.\"Another group of scholars maintained that it suffices for a person to resolve in his heart that he will fast the following day. According to them, the time for making the intention extends from sunset till before noon. Therefore, a person who forgets to make the intention during the night is to make it any time before noon such that the remaining part of the day is greater than the former. Maliki scholars maintained that it suffices to make a single intention for a consecutive fast such as Ramadan.The rulingIt can be concluded from the above that the principle and better course of action is to make the intention for each fast day if possible. But if a person fears forgetfulness, he is to make the intention for the current performance of the Ramadan fast for the sake of Allah on the eve of the first night of Ramadan. According to Hanafi scholars, it is not a condition to make the intention for fasting Ramadan since it is an obligatory fast. A person's fast is valid as long as he refrains from food and drink."

    "Answer": "Women during menstruation and post-natal bleeding are legally obligated to break their fast Scholars have agreed that it is prohibited for menstruating women or women in post natal bleeding to fast and that, if they do, their fast will be invalid. They have also unanimously agreed that breaking a fast due to menstruation necessitates making up the missed fast days only. Making up the missed fast daysIt is not obligatory to make up the missed fast days immediately after Ramadan if there was a valid excuse for breaking one's fast. Rather, the matter is open and a person may make up his missed fast days anytime during the upcoming year before the next Ramadan. Evidence from SunnaIt was authentically reported that the mother of the believers, 'A`isha (may Allah be pleased with her), used to make up her missed fast days in Sha'ban [Muslim]. Scholarly opinions A woman who fails to make up her missed fasts before the next Ramadan is to fast that Ramadan and make up her missed fasts afterwards. - Hanafi scholars and al-Hassan al-Basri maintained that a woman who fails to make up her missed fasts before next Ramadan does not pay fidya [compensation] whether or not she had an excuse for this delay. - Imams Malik, Al-Shafi'i and Ahmed maintained that it is obligatory for a woman to simply make up her missed fasts if she had an excuse for the delay; otherwise, she is obliged to pay a fidya in addition to making up her missed fasts. This is the opinion we advocate.It is not a condition to make up missed fast days of Ramadan consecutively The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, \"He can make them up either separately or consecutively, as he wishes\" [Al-Darqatni].

    "Answer": "According to the majority of scholars, an enema invalidates the fast if used deliberately. This is because the injected liquid reaches an internal body cavity through an open orifice. The Maliki scholar, Al-Lakhmiy, maintained that an enema is permissible and does not break the fast. This is one opinion of the Shafi'i school as expressed by the judge Hussien.In one of their opinions, Maliki scholars maintained that an enema as disliked. Ibn Habib said, \"The salaf [predecessors] and people of knowledge disliked the use of enemas for treatment except for an indispensable necessity and if there is no other alternative. For this reason, it is recommended to make up the fast when using it.\" Ibn Abd al-Bar, the Maliki hadith scholar, said in Al-Kafi fi Fiqh Ahl Al-Madina, \"It was reported that it is [merely] recommended and not obligatory to make up the fast due to an enema administration. This is the opinion we chose in our school since the fast is broken by anything that enters the throat and a body cavity through the mouth.\" Ibn Juziy said in Al-Qawanin Al-Fiqhiya that there are three opinions concerning enemas:1. It breaks the fast according to Abu Hanifa and Ibn Hanbal.2. It does not invalidate the fast3. Only enemas which inject liquids invalidate the fast.The rulingBased on this, it is permissible to follow the opinion of the Malikis for whoever finds it necessary to use an enema while fasting and cannot delay its administration till after breaking his fast. The fast in this case is valid and it is not obligatory to make it up. However, it is recommended for such a person to make up his fast to remove himself from scholarly differences.Allah the Almighty knows best"

    "Question": "What is the ruling on appointing a female ma`zun(1) from the standpoint of Islamic law?",
    "Answer": "Scholars have maintained that a ruler is entitled to conduct a marriage in place of bride's wali (guardian) if the latter is absent or dead. Some have even said that the ruler is the wali for the one has no wali. It is known that a ma`zun is one who is authorized by the ruler-the authorities or judge-to act in his stead in conducting marriage contracts.Therefore, the ma`zun's job is not only confined to registering the contract but in some instances it extends to some of the duties of a wali. Fiqh of Abu Hanifa Egypt follows the juristic school of Imam Abu Hanifa al-Nu'man (may Allah be pleased with him) in matters of family law. It is established in Hanafi jurisprudence that it is permissible for a woman of sound judgment to conclude her own marriage (without a wali), act as a wali for a close relative or be commissioned to effect the marriage agreement of another. Just as a woman is entitled to manage her financial affairs, she has exclusive right in matters concerning marriage.Evidence from the Qur`anAs evidenced by the following verses, Allah the Almighty attributes the right to conduct marriage to women, thereby demonstrating the validity of undertaking and executing their own marriages.There is no blame on you if they dispose of themselves in a just and reasonable manner. [Al-Baqarah, 234]Do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands, if they mutually agree on equitable terms. [Al-Baqarah, 232]So if a husband divorces his wife (irrevocably), He cannot, after that, re-marry her until after she has married another husband and He has divorced her. [Al-Baqarah, 230]Practical evidenceThe Prophet said, \"An unmarried woman [a virgin or a previously married woman] has more right over herself than her wali.\"Khansa` bint Khidham was given away in marriage by her father against her wishes so the Prophet nullified the contract [Bukhari].A woman gave her daughter away in marriage with the latter's consent. The bride's guardians objected to the marriage so they brought the case before 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) who approved of the marriage.'A`isha (may Allah be pleased with her) acted as the wali of her niece, the daughter of Abdul- Rahman, in her marriage to Mundhir Ibn Zubair.The ruling If a woman, in Hanafi jurisprudence, is entitled to act as a wali for herself and others, then it is permissible to invest her with the authority to conduct a marriage contract. If this is so, then it is a greater priority to grant her permission to register the marriage. This is because registration is based on justice and knowledge both of which are existent in an upright woman of knowledge. The above is the legal ruling concerning this issue. A ruler, who wishes to issue a law to this effect, must ensure that it conforms to the different aspects of the reality of the times and takes into consideration any ensuing benefits and harm."

    "Question": "Is it prohibited to pierce one's nose or belly button?",
    "Answer": "Women's love for adornment is something innate. God Almighty created women and endeared adornment to them. God described women in the Qur'an as a creature who is naturally brought up on adornment. He Almighty says:\"A creature who is brought up in adornments (wearing silk and gold ornaments, i.e. women), and in dispute cannot make herself clear?\" [Qur'an 43: 18].Since the religion of Islam is a primordial religion [Deen al-Fitra], it permitted for women all kinds of adornments. Scholars unanimously agreed that it is permissible for women to use all kinds of gold and silver adornments such as all types of necklaces, rings, bracelets, anklets, amulets and all what they like to wear and it doesn’t reach the degree of extravagance or imitating men.- Women's adornments differ from one culture to another scholars stated that it is permissible for women to adorn themselves with gold according to the customs prevailing in their communities and cultures. The Hanbali scholar, Ibn Qudama said in \"al-Mughni\" (3205/2): \"It is permissible for women to wear all kinds of gold and silver adornments as well as jewelry according to what is common in their customs, such as bracelets, anklets, earrings, rings and what they wear on their faces, necks, hands, legs, ears and the like. However, it is prohibited for women to wear what is not familiar to them to wear, such as the belt and the like of men's adornment. This is likewise if a man wears female ornaments.\" - Harm is prohibited in the Islamic law On the other hand, Islamic law prohibited harm. It is generally established by the legal axiom: \"Do not cause harm and do not reciprocate harm\". Therefore, scholars differed over the kind of adornments that cause pain for a woman such as the earrings that require piercing the ear. The accomplished scholars maintained that Islamic law endorsed women's love for adornment according to the degree of necessity. Based on this, it permitted for women to adorn themselves in this way [piercing] as long as it is in agreement with their customs and provided it does not pose harm.- The ruling Based on this, there is no objection to women piercing their nose with the purpose of adornment if it is the custom in such countries provided it doesn’t cause harm. However, if it is proved that it causes harm or the procedure is not carried out through a correct medical way, it is then prohibited."

    "Question": "Can my dad force me to wear hijab and is he allowed to threaten me not to support me financially if I chose not to wear it?",
    "Answer": "The Islamic law states that hijab is an obligation on adult women as God says in the Quran “And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests” (24:31)Also Dawud, al Baihaqi and al Tabarani reported that lady ‘Aisha said that Asmaa daughter of Abu Bakr walked in with her light clothes so the Prophet turned away and said “ O Asmaa when the woman reaches puberty, she is only allowed to reveal this and this” and he pointed to his face and hands.Therefore if the girl has reached puberty and does not wear hijab, it would be her father’s duty to advise her kindly without hurting her or imposing his authority on her with compulsion or violence because his advice barely falls in advising the good and forbidding the bad. God says in the Quran, And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful. 3:104And the Prophet said that religion is all about advising and he repeated this phrase three times so the companions asked “to whom O Messenger of God” and he said “to God, His holy book, His messenger and the leaders of the Ummah and the people in general”. Therefore the father should advise his daughter wisely and not to harm her in anyway through beating or hurting or refraining from spending on her or through any other forms of harm. Also he has no right to force her to leave her job as he should not make the issue of wearing the hijab as a condition for conducting her life normally because this might lead her to be repulsive from religion altogether and its juristic rulings. Also practicing any kinds of enforcement from the father’s side will lead his daughter to be a hypocrite who only practices religion as long as he is around. God does not want the surrender of bodies but rather wants the submission of hearts and this can only be applied through developing a sense that she is mindful of God all the time as this state is the state of excellence which Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) talked about and described this state as “worshipping God as if you see Him and if you don’t see Him, He sees you”.Therefore the father is only entitled to advise his daughter about wearing hijab without causing her any harm through beating or refraining from spending financially on her because spending on his daughter is a duty on him as long as he is her guardian and that she can’t support herself financially and this state continues regardless of his daughter wearing hijab or not. It is out of Islam’s mercy that it did not condition payment for one’s children’s expenditure on completing their religious duties and obligations."

    "Question": "I started wearing niqab a few weeks ago. Alhamdulillah, where I live it is common for women to wear niqab and not wear niqab. I know it is permissible to cover my face, but I am wondering something. Is it wrong to uncover my face when there is a need? For example, I needed to go to a bank and I lifted my niqab because I feel covering the face in a bank is bad, given the constant risk that banks are in as far as robbery is concerned. Or what if a merchant wishes to verify my identity for a purchase? Or what if I am thirsty and wish to drink water? The thing is, many of the Muslims here who wear niqab or support wearing niqab are very strict, and I do not agree with them and their ideas that women should be silent in public and should never show their face and hands, even for a legitimate security check, unless a female officer and a private area are available. I am not so strict, and I know that the Shafi\\'i view is that the hands and face are not part of nakedness so I don\\'t understand what the big deal is if I show my face for a legitimate need in public. I just want to make sure that if I\\'m doing this, I\\'m correct as far as the Shari\\'ah is concerned. I like wearing niqab because it makes me focus on my behaviour and keeps my nafs in check, but at the same time I feel strange associating myself by my clothing with people who have an extreme view compared to mine.",
    "Answer": "The legal attire of a Muslim woman - It is must not cling to the body. - It must not be transparent. - It must cover the entire body except for the face and hands. - There is no objection in wearing colorful garments on the condition that they are not eye-catching or arouse desire.• Ruling on wearing Niqab [En. Face cover] and gloves - The majority of scholars maintain that it is not obligatory for a woman to wear niqab and gloves; it is permissible for a woman to uncover her face and hands. They base this permissibility on the words of Allah: …and not display their charms beyond what [it is acceptable] to reveal… [An-Nur, 31]. The majority of scholars from among the Companions and their successors interpreted the words \"beyond what it is acceptable to reveal\" [Ar. al-zina al-zahira] as uncovering the face and hands. This interpretation was reported from Ibn 'Abass, Anas and 'Aisha (may Allah be pleased with them all). -They further base this permissibility on another Qur`anic verse:They (women) should let their headscarves [Ar.khimar] fall to cover their chests … [An-Nur, 31]. The khimar is a head cover while al-jayb is the front opening of a dress and the like. In this verse Allah commands Muslim women to cover their chests with their headscarves. If it were obligatory to cover the face, it would have been explicitly mentioned in the verse.Evidence from Sunnah'Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that Asmaa`, daughter of Abu Bakr, entered upon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) wearing transparent clothes. He turned his face away from her and said: \"O Asmaa! When a woman reaches menarche, nothing should be seen [of her body] except this and this\" and he pointed to his face and hands [Abu Dawud]. There are other clear evidences stating that it is not obligatory to cover the face and hands. To conclude, it is not obligatory for a Muslim woman to cover her face and hands. If she covers her face and hands, it is permissible and if she wears the legal attire without covering her face and hands, it is likewise permissible and fulfills the obligation. The obligatory hijab for the adult Muslim woman is that which covers her entire body except for her face and feet, though Hanafi scholars permit uncovering the feet. If these conditions are fulfilled, it is permissible for a woman to wear whatever she wishes and, in this case, Islam does not impose certain attire. Niqab is not obligatory according to the majority of scholars but Islam commands us to follow customs in lawful matters.Removing niqab [face cover] is not a sin. A woman will be blameworthy when she is over strict in a matter which Allah has left open for her. Niqab is not obligatory nor is it recommended according to the opinion of some scholars. There is no objection to a woman removing it and she will not be blameworthy."

    "Answer": "It is obligatory for every Muslim woman who has reached the age of legal accountability (which is the age when a woman first begins menstruation), to wear the hijab. This ruling is established in the Quran, sunna, and by the consensus of the Muslim community. In the Quran, Allah the Almighty says:O Prophet, tell your wives, your daughters, and women believers to make their outer garments hang low over them. [33:59]In the chapter of Nur, Allah the Almighty says:And tell believing women that they should lower their glances, guard their private parts, and not display their charms beyond what [it is acceptable] to reveal; they should let their headscarves fall to cover their necklines and not reveal their charms. [24:31]In the Prophetic traditions, the Prophet said: “O, Asmaa! If a woman reaches menarche nothing should be seen [of her body] except this and this,” and he pointed to her face and hands.1This is the consensus of the Muslims from the earliest generations and their successors.

    "Question": "I do not wear the hijab. Will Allah accept my fast and prayers?",
    "Answer": "Hijab, the legal attire of a Muslim woman is a duty imposed by Allah Almighty. He prohibited her from exposing those parts of her body which she has been commanded to conceal from men who are not of her unmarriageable kin. The legal attire is that which conceals the entire body except the face and hands; it must not be revealing, transparent nor cling to the body.All legal duties must be observedThe various legal duties are not interchangeable. For instance, it is impermissible for one who performs prayers to forsake fasting. Similarly, praying and fasting do not justify that a woman neglect wearing the legal attire.A Muslim woman who prays and fasts but does not wear the legal attire is blameless in regards to her fast and prayers but blameworthy for not wearing the hijab which is obligatory. Whether Allah will accept her fast and prayers is a matter that is left to the Almighty; a Muslim is obliged to think the best of Allah the Glorious even if he or she has sinned or disobeyed Allah. Allah is most MercifulA Muslim must know that one of the many kinds of mercies that Allah extends to man, is His decree that good deeds erase the bad and not vice-versa. A Muslim must also open a new page with Allah, repent from any sins and make the month of Ramadan the starting point for embarking on good deeds that would lead him to Allah the Almighty and earn HimHis favor. A Muslim woman, upon whom Allah has bestowed the gift of prayers, fasting during Ramadan and obedience to Him must show gratitude by performing the duties she has neglected. This is because one of the signs that a good deed has been accepted is being conferred the success of following up that good deed with another.Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to go out wearing jewelry, accessories, nail polish and high heels?",
    "Answer": "The legal attire required of a Muslim woman is: • Any garment which does not cling to the body. • It must not be transparent. • It must conceal the entire body except the face and hands. There is no harm in wearing colored clothes provided they are not vibrant, eye catching, or do not incite desire. If these conditions are fulfilled in any garment, it is then permissible for women to wear it and go out. The above definition of the legal attire required of a Muslim woman, is encompassed by the words of God: \"Wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests\" and in God's words to the Prophet [pbuh] in the chapter of \"Ahzab\": \" And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts.\"In the Arabic language, Khimar refers to any garment that covers a woman's hair and chest. It is impermissible to restrict the linguistic meaning of khimar as intended in the Qur`anic verses to the known manner in which it is worn because the current manner of wearing the khimar is a cultural practice. Any garment that covers the hair and chest is considered a khimar even it does not resemble what the people agreed upon as khimar.Based on the above and in reference to the question, it is obligatory upon a Muslim woman to cover her hair, chest and entire body except her face and hands with any garments of her choice. She is not obligated to wear a specific attire since rulings are contingent upon objects and not upon their designations."

    "Answer": "Hijab is a religious requirement for every Muslim woman who reached puberty and it necessitates covering the whole body except for the face and the hands. Hijab in Islam is a sign of modesty. Modesty is a grace which is required by both men and women in terms of lowering their gaze and guarding their chastity. When it comes to the first part of your question about your relatives, it would be important to understand that personal convictions differ from one person to another. These convictions stem from personal traits, religious bases, cultural backgrounds and social milieu.Your conviction of wearing hijab stems from a religious base and your decision should be respected as a personal choice you have made. It is very important for a healthy social relationship to be based on respect and understanding of people’s personal convictions. Therefore, your relatives need to learn how to appreciate differences in opinions and modes of thinking. From your part, it would be important for you to stand firm for what you believe in as people are defined by their convictions.When it comes to your work place, you need to define the “not accepting” part.

The statement of Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud reached a woman from Bani Asad who was called Um Ya'cub.

The one mentioned in the book of Allah the Almighty [Meaning the Prophet] Allah says: So accept whatever the Messenger gives you, and abstain from whatever he forbids you. [59:7]• Plucking: The ruling of plucking parts of the face other than the eyebrows varies between prohibition and permissibility. Upon this the scholars based their difference.Important Terms:• Al-Namsa: is the one who plucks her or others eyebrows. • Al-Mutnamsa: is the one who orders others to do so.• The ruling for unmarried woman:Threatening one to with the curse of Allah and his Prophet is a sign that an action is from the Major sins. In Islamic law when such a threat is issued it is evidence that the act is a major sin and a sign that the act is impermissible.It is forbidden for a non married woman to have her eye brows plucked, except for the purpose of treatment, removing a defect, or refining excessive hair. Things other than this are prohibited.• The ruling for a married woman:It is permissible for a married woman to pluck her eyebrows with her husband's permission according to the majority of scholars, since, it is considered from what are classified in Islamic law as adornments [Ar: Zenah].The narration of Bukra bint 'Uqba was used as evidence, when she asked 'Aisha may Allah be pleased with her about plucking her eyebrows, 'Aisha responded:If you are married, and by plucking your eyebrows you will make them attractive, then do it\". Ahkam al-Nis'a Ibn al-Jawsi p.49Al-Tabari mentioned a narration through the wife of Abu Ishaa, who was an attractive woman when she came to 'Aisha may Allah be pleased with her—she asked: “Should a woman pluck her facial hair for her husband?”She answered:\"Keep disturbances [from you and your husband] away as much as possible.\"Allah the Majestic knows best."

    "Question": "A new board council is established in the mosque of East Anglia in the city of Norwich in the UK and this council includes some Arab and English women. The decision in this council is taken through voting so is it permissible for women to vote in this council or is it only for men to vote?",
    "Answer": "Islam equated between both men and women in terms of duties and rights except for the rights they acquire due to their natural differences. The woman in Islam is given full rights, her status is elevated and her independent financial capacity is acknowledged. Islam confirmed the woman’s independent legal acts which are granted according to her legal rights along with her right to practice all her civil rights which are in harmony with her God-given nature.One of the forms of equal rights which are granted to both men and women is the right of exchanging opinions and consultation in general and private matters and in religious and irreligious issues. God says in the Quran, “The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Those - Allah will have mercy upon them. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.” 9:71The verse did not differentiate between men and women in practicing their right to command the good and forbid the bad, voting is a kind of advice which includes commanding the good and forbidding the bad. The same concept applies on the allegiance of women in which women vowed to the Prophet to support Islam and defend it. God says, “O Prophet, when the believing women come to you pledging to you that they will not associate anything with Allah , nor will they steal, nor will they commit unlawful sexual intercourse, nor will they kill their children, nor will they bring forth a slander they have invented between their arms and legs, nor will they disobey you in what is right - then accept their pledge and ask forgiveness for them of Allah . Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.” 60:12Consulting women was a popular matter during the Prophet’s time and one of these examples is when the Prophet consulted his wife Um Salamah in the truce of Hudaybiyya. Also lady Asmaa bint Abu Bakr gave advice to her son ‘Abdullah ibn al Zubair regarding some legal matters.Also preventing women from voting implies concealing her knowledge and silencing her advice which is legally impermissible. God says in the Quran, “And [mention, O Muhammad], when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture, [saying], \"You must make it clear to the people and not conceal it.\" But they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it for a small price. And wretched is that which they purchased.” 3:187 It is known that those who were given the Scripture are held accountable for their deeds and they include both genders; no one has ever claimed that this accountability concerns only men. The relative pronoun in the verse is only masculine in accordance with the practice of most of the Qur`anic verses and sunnah texts.The Prophet (peace be upon him) warned us against concealing our knowledge and Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said in this regard, “Whoever was asked about knowledge and concealed it will be bridled in the Day of Judgment with a bridle from fire”. (Abu Dawud)God also says, “There is not upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who do not find anything to spend any discomfort when they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger. There is not upon the doers of good any cause [for blame]. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.” 9:91So God conditioned the legal excuse for the sick and the weak people not to go to jihad with their ability to give advice to God and His prophet. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Religion is about advice, religion is about advice, religion is about advice and they said “To whom O Messenger of God”, he said, “To God, His Book, His Prophet, and the leaders of the Ummah and the general public”. (Muslim)When this kind of understanding of equity between men and women in terms of their duties and rights was well absorbed by the Muslim scholars, they understood the Prophet’s tradition in which he said, “Women are the sisters of men” (Tirmidhi)If some people claim that women lack the necessary knowledge which enable them to vote in legal matters, we can cite for them the renowned role of lady ‘Aisha who was a prominent jurist and an eminent scholar who had her own legal school of jurisprudence from which graduated many of the renowned legal scholars. The Islamic history attests to the valuable status of women and their contribution in many fields of knowledge. It is also important to mention that one of the main reasons of the Prophet’s multiple marriages is for his wives to transmit the Prophet’s acts and sayings to the general public. God says in the Quran, “And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of Allah and wisdom. Indeed, Allah is ever Subtle and Acquainted [with all things].” 33:34Therefore women have the full right to vote in the above mentioned council just as men do"

    "Question": "he petitioner says that her menstrual cycle started at the age of 14. Since then and for many years, she would refrain from fasting in Ramadan [during her period] for 7 days without making them up.",
    "Answer": "Women during menstruation and post-natal bleeding are legally obligated to break their fastScholars have agreed that it is prohibited for menstruating women or women in post natal bleeding to fast and that, if they do, their fast will be invalid. They have also unanimously agreed that breaking a fast due to menstruation necessitates making up the missed fast days only. Making up the missed fast daysIt is not obligatory to make up the missed fast days immediately after Ramadan if there was a valid excuse for breaking one's fast. Rather, the matter is open and a person may make up his missed fast days anytime during the upcoming year before the next Ramadan. Evidence from SunnaIt was authentically reported that the mother of the believers, 'A`isha (may Allah be pleased with her), used to make up her missed fast days in Sha'ban [Muslim]. Scholarly opinions A woman who fails to make up her missed fasts before the next Ramadan is to fast that Ramadan and make up her missed fasts afterwards. - Hanafi scholars and al-Hassan al-Basri maintained that a woman who fails to make up her missed fasts before next Ramadan does not pay fidya [compensation] whether or not she had an excuse for this delay. - Imams Malik, Al-Shafi'i and Ahmed maintained that it is obligatory for a woman to simply make up her missed fasts if she had an excuse for the delay; otherwise, she is obliged to pay a fidya in addition to making up her missed fasts. This is the opinion we advocate.It is not a condition to make up missed fast days of Ramadan consecutively The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, \"He can make them up either separately or consecutively, as he wishes\" [Al-Darqatni]. The ruling It is obligatory for the petitioner to hasten making up the accumulated missed fasts before the arrival of next Ramadan. Allah Most High knows best."

    "Question": "My client, who is also my brother, obtained court ordered child visitation entitling him to visit his small daughter for only three hours a week. This time is insufficient for him to care for his daughter, create an emotional bond between them, and build familiarity between himself and his daughter and between her and her father's family. Can my brother take the child during the summer and public holidays, and increase the number of weekly visitation hours?",
    "Answer": "Child custody and its regulation is but a means for protecting and looking after the child and maintaining its rights and affairs. The custodian's wish to waive the right to custody is not effective since protecting the child is the ultimate goal of regulating the affairs of custody.Child custody is not an arena in which the divorced spouses may use cunning against each other at the expense of their child's interest. Rather, it is guardianship of upbringing, the aim of which is the welfare of the child, guaranteeing its interests and maintaining its affairs. Islamic law made this guardianship contingent on safeguarding the child's person and its religious and moral welfare. On the other hand, it is a good opportunity to accustom oneself to sacrifice and altruism.The law regulating child custody, which is derived from the honorable Islamic law, aims to achieve this objective and revolves around it. If the letter of law fails to achieve the child's interests, then they become subject to the discretionary authority of the judge who is thoroughly knowledgeable of the Legislator's intents and goals.The ruling• It is permissible for the judge to permit your brother to schedule one day a week, a suitable period during the mid-year and end of year holidays, and during the other public holidays to take his daughter as he sees fit and just.• The judge must take into consideration the custodial mother's wish to guarantee her child's safety and at the same time preserve the father's right to raise and monitor his child's upbringing.• The judge is authorized to adjudicate [custody and visitation rights and schedules] with a clear conscience as long as he aims to achieve the desired objective of Islamic law which is solid custodianship and optimal child welfare.Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling for relatives' right (paternal grandparents, uncles and aunts) to see their granddaughter and niece who is living with her custodial mother at her maternal grandparents' residence?",
    "Answer": "Paragraph 2 of Article 20 of Decree Law no. 25 (1929) amended by Law no. 100 (1985) states: \"Both parents are entitled to child visitation. Grandparents enjoy the same right in the absence of the parents.\" The phrase 'in the absence of the parents' denotes either their death or residence in a country other than the child's country of residence. We recommend that visitation rights be granted to paternal grandparents (if the child is in its mother's custody or in the custody of a female maternal relative) as well as to paternal uncles and aunts even if the father is alive or lives in the same country as the child's custodian. This is because a paternal grandfather is considered a father both in the linguistic sense and in Islamic law — he is an ancestor who occupies the same status as a father in matters concerning inheritance, expenditure, guardianship, and the obligation to pay blood-money. Moreover, the child carries his name and he is a reason for its coming into existence. For this reason, the Qur`an refers to a grandfather as 'father' as in the verse,As for the wall, it belonged to two youths, orphans, in the town; there was, beneath it, a buried treasure, to which they were entitled; their father had been a righteous man. [Al-Kahf: 82]Al-Baidawi said, \"It is said that [the 'father' referred to in the above verse] is the orphans' paternal grandfather, seven times removed.\" An uncle likewise occupies the same status as a father as expressed in the Qur`an by Jacob's sons,We shall worship thy God and the God of thy fathers, of Abraham, Isma'il, and Isaac. [Al-Baqarah: 133]It is known that Abraham was Jacob's grandfather (peace be upon them) though the Qur`an mentions him as 'father' and Isma'il (peace be upon him) was Jacob's paternal uncle though the Qur`an refers to him as Jacob's 'father'. Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, \"O 'Umar! Do you know that that a man's uncle occupies the same status as his father?\" [recorded by Muslim and others]. Allah the Almighty says of Abraham's uncle,Lo! Abraham said to his father Azar. [Al-An'am: 74]Abraham renounced his uncle when it later became apparent to him that he was an enemy of Allah the Almighty. In his last days, Abraham supplicated for his own father, who was a believer, and said,\"O our Lord! Cover (us) with Thy forgiveness—me, my parents, and (all) believers, on the Day that the Reckoning will be established!\"[Ibrahim: 41]The same argument applies to a mother's relatives if the child is in its father's custody or is later removed to its father's guardianship after reaching the legal age for leaving the guardianship of females. This is the ruling issued by the Court of Alexandria in case no. 335 for the year 1931: \"Do the child's relatives enjoy the same rights as its mother concerning visitation? There is no explicit text on this in the books of Islamic jurisprudence except for what was mentioned in the book Fatawa Al-Mahdiyyah in the chapter on custody. It states, 'A man took custody of his daughter after she reached the legal age for joining him and placed her with her paternal brother. Her mother and maternal aunt who was the child's custodian after the mother remarried, wish to have access to the child once a week or once a month. So do you consent to this request and is the child's brother entitled to prevent them from having access to the child?' The answer was, 'The mother and maternal aunt are not to be prevented from visiting the child. The child's brother is not entitled to prevent them from visitations without a legal precept ...'This ruling clarifies the necessity of habituating the child to observing paternal and maternal kinship rights and preserving them. It also shows the necessity of preserving the rights of adult relatives concerning visitations as well as establishing justice and equity in granting the same rights to the relatives of the non-custodial parent as those granted to the relatives of the custodial parent. This is the great design of the Law Maker, Allah the Almighty, and a requisite of Islamic law.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "The questioner asked that he and his wife agreed that they will name their newborn Yusuf if it is a boy, or Leila if it is a girl. The wife [now] wants to use different names out of spite and out of rebellion against her husband.Who has the right to name children when the parents disagree?What is the ruling in my going against my wife and desire to name our children with names dear to me?",
    "Answer": "It is obligatory for spouses to have mutual agreement and understanding in order to create affection and mercy, conforming to what Allah Most High says: And of his signs is this: He created for you mates from yourselves that ye might find rest in them, and He ordained between you love and mercy. Lo, therein indeed are portents for folk who reflect.1Based upon this and concerning the question:When spouses disagree about naming their newborn, the husband has the right to name the newborn – male or female – because the Prophet said, “Verily, on Judgment Day you will be called forth with your names and the names of your fathers. So choose your names well.”2 [In this hadith] the phrasing and its imperative address males; and the father is the one who provides for the family, so one of his rights is choosing the newborn’s name.We advise the petitioner and his wife to come to an agreement, and not to leave Shaytan any opportunity to come between them.And Allah Most High knows best.________________________________________1.

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6113/who-must-pay-childrens-expenses",
    "Question": "If a father is on pension and has a child undergoing his studies, who should bear the latter's expenses — the father or his eldest son who was exempted from military service and is the family's breadwinner? Is the father obligated to bear the expenses of his adult daughter who cannot find work?",
    "Answer": "There is a scholarly consensus on a father's obligation to bear his children's expenses due to the words of Allah the Almighty Who says,… and clothing and maintenance must be borne by the father in a fair manner. [Al-Baqarah, 233]Since Allah obligates a father to provide for his child's mother on account of her child, then it is with greater reason for him to support his child due to the words of the Prophet to Hind, Abu Sufyan's wife, when he told her, \"Take what suffices you and your children with fairness\" [reported by Bukhari and others through 'A`isha (may Allah be pleased with her)]. Had not a child been entitled to paternal support, the Prophet would not have permitted Hind to take from her husband's money; this is because a Muslim's property is sacred. ConditionsA father must be either financially capable of supporting his child or able to earn in excess of his own expenses. A father's obligation to support his child is not waived except if he is incapable of earning a livelihood such that he is financially dependent on any of his ancestors or descendents. In such a case, the obligation to support his child is waived and he is considered nonexistent since it is not feasible to require him to provide for others when he himself receives financial aid. This is the opinion of scholars concerning paternal support which rests solely with the father. Because a child is attributed to its father and is a part of him, the obligation of child support is not waived except on account of his financial disability.Who must support the child if the father is financially compromised?If the father is financially compromised and does not earn a living, the obligation rests with those who are obliged to support the child had the father been absent; these include the grandfather, brother, paternal uncle and their children. The expenses are considered a debt upon the father who must pay it back whenever he is able to.Children are entitled to paternal expenses if they are financially compromised and do not have money or any income. A father is not obliged to support a child who has the means to support himself. However, in contemporary societies, a student is unable to earn his living on account of his studies which will qualify him in the future to earn a living.The opinion implemented for fatwa and by courtsFinancial support is incumbent upon relatives to whom marriage is forbidden other than ancestors or descendants. These include brothers and sisters and their children, and maternal and paternal uncles and aunts. This is based on the words of Allah the Almighty Who says,The same duty is incumbent upon the father's heir. [Al-Baqarah: 233].In Ibn Mas'ud's non-canonical (Ar. shadh) Qur`anic recitation, the verse reads as, \"The same duty is incumbent upon a father's non-marriageable heirs.\" This is the opinion of Hanafi scholars whose condition for this obligation is affluence and not merely the ability to earn a living. This is because financial support of relatives is by way of maintaining ties of kinship — it is not obligatory except for an affluent relative. It is also a condition that financial support of relatives be established by a judicial verdict. The book Bada`i Al-Sana`i mentions that supporting other than one's children is not obligatory without a judicial verdict and therefore requires filing a lawsuit."

    "Question": "Who should bear children's expenses?",
    "Answer": "There is no disagreements among the scholars that it is incumbent upon fathers to bear the expenses of their young children, whether males or females. Imam Al-Mawardi said in Al-Hawi, \"Fathers bear the expenses of their children based on the Qur`an, sunnah, and scholarly consensus. The Qur`anic verse,But he shall bear the cost of [the mothers'] food and clothing on equitable terms. [Al-Baqarah, 233]proves the father's obligation, and not the mother's, to support his children.\"[1]Imam Al-Qurtubi said in Al-Jami' Li Ahkam Al-Qur`an: \"[This verse] proves a father's obligation to provide for his child on account of the latter's weakness and incapability. For this reason, the verse stipulates that a mother is to receive payment during pregnancy and the nursing period since the infant can only be nourished through her nursing. This is reinforced in the verse,And if they are pregnant, then spend (your sustenance) on them. [At-Talaq, 6]Scholars are unanimous that it is incumbent upon a man to support his children who do not have the means to do so on their own. Hind Bint 'Utba [wife of Abu Sufyan] complained to the Prophet about her husband's miserliness and said, 'Abu Sufyan is a miser. I do not receive from him what suffices my children and me unless I take from him without his knowledge. Am I sinful for this?' The Prophet replied, 'Take only what suffices you and your children in a fair and reasonable amount.' \"[2]The rulingIt is obligatory upon the father, and not the mother, to provide for his daughter. Moreover, he must bear the expenses of all her needs including food, clothing and the like according to what is customary for those of a similar [social] class.Allah the Almighty knows best.[1] 11/447, Dar Kutub al-Ilmiyyah.

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6134/does-the-father-have-the-right-to-force-his-daughter-to-marry-someone-she-doesn’t",
    "Question": "Does Islam give a father the right to force his daughter to marry someone that she doesn’t want to marry? Can a woman end a marriage in Islam or is that solely the right of the man?",
    "Answer": "Islam treats men and women equally in regards to the right to choose a mate. It has not given parents the authority to compel them [to marry someone]. The parents’ role in marrying off their children is manifested in giving advice, direction, and guidance; they do not have the right to force their children, whether they are sons or daughters, to marry someone they do not want to marry. The final say in this belongs to the children themselves.Marriage is one of a person’s private affairs and it is impermissible for parents to force their daughter to marry someone she does not want to marry since that would be oppression and a transgression on the rights of others. In Islam women have complete freedom to accept or reject whoever comes to propose to them. Neither her father nor her legal guardian has the right to force her to marry someone she does not want, for married life cannot be based on compulsion and coercion which are in contradiction to the love and mercy that God has placed between man and wife.Many legal texts from our pure tradition indicate this firmly established ruling, and actual events make it clear to all how the Prophet, dealt with a woman and her guardian and challenged all of the norms of the jahiliyah that oppressed women by affirming her right to choose her husband and nullifying the marriage of those who tried to compel her even if that person was her father. We cannot fail to notice the contravention of the traditions of the Arabs at the time that this entailed. This was a test of the believers’ hearts to be satisfied with the pure law that honored women and respected their will and choice, while freeing themselves of all the norms that did not value women, disdained, and oppressed them.The prophetic texts that refer to this all affirm this right as in is the saying of the Prophet, “A widow may not be married until she has been consulted, and a virgin may not be married until her consent has been sought.” They said, “O Messenger of God, how does she give consent?” He said, “By remaining silent.” Similarly he dealt equitably with girl who came to him complaining that her father had forced her to get married, as is established in his sunna where it is related that, “A young virgin girl came to the Prophet and told him that her father had married her off and that she was averse [to it], so the Prophet gave her the choice [of whether or not to remain married].” It is related that a man married off his daughter who was averse [to the marriage], so she came to the Messenger of God and said something to the affect that her father married her off and she was averse [to the marriage]. Furthermore, she said, “and my cousin was betrothed to me.” The Prophet said, “He has no marriage; marry whomsoever you wish.”Khansa’ bint Khudham said, “My father married me off, and I was averse [to the marriage], and I was a virgin, so I complained of it to the Prophet who said, “Do not marry her if she is averse [to it].” It is related that there was a woman from among the Ansar who was married to a man from among the Ansar. The man was killed in the Battle of Uhud and he had one son from her. Her son’s uncle was betrothed to her so he married her to the man and disregarded her son’s uncle. She came to the Prophet and said, “My father married me to a man that I do not want and disregarded my son’s uncle, so my son is going to be taken from me.” The Prophet called her father and said, “Did you marry so and so to so and so?” He said, “Yes.” The Prophet said, “You are the one who has no right to make marriages.” [Then he said to the woman,] “Go marry your son’s uncle.” Concerning the hadith of the Prophet narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim that says, “Aisha asked the Prophet if a young girl whose family marries her off should be consulted. He said, ‘Yes, she should be consulted.’ Aisha said, ‘But they are shy.’ He said, ‘If she remains silent, that is her consent.’” Ibn al-Qayyim says, “We adopt this fatwa; a virgin must be consulted [concerning her marriage]. There is an authentic tradition that the Prophet said, ‘Widows are more deserving of [deciding for] themselves than their fathers; virgins are consulted concerning themselves, and their consent is their silence.’ In one version it reads, ‘The virgin’s permission is sought by her father, and her permission is her silence.’ It is related in al-Bukhari and Muslim that the Prophet said, ‘Do not marry off a virgin girl until her permission is sought.’ They asked, ‘How is her permission [given]?’ He replied, ‘By remaining silent.’ And a young virgin girl told him that her father married her off and she was averse [to the marriage], so the Prophet gave her the option [whether or not to remain married]. So he enjoined seeking out the consent of the virgin girl, forbade marrying her off without it, and gave an option to whoever had been married without having their permission sought. How then can we leave all of this and go against it?” The attention Islam pays to the issue of choice between a husband and wife is, in reality, a concern for the nucleus of the family. Family begins with a man and a woman who come together with a great deal of mutual understanding that has an affect on the family when it grows and its members increase. Family is the essential building block of society, and upon this sound basis civilizations are established and values are elevated.The words of Ahmed Shawqi, the Egyptian Prince of Poets bears witness to the importance of women in the foundation of Muslim society, “Mothers are schools if you prepared them…then you prepared a great nation”.Just as Islam gave women the right to choose their husbands, it also gave them the right to choose whether to remain with them or part from them when relations between them become soured and reconciliation and compromise cannot be reached. Divorce was incorporated into the law for the benefit of both women and men alike. One of the widespread misconceptions of Islam and its family structure is that men are the only ones who have the right to end a marriage, that they are the only ones who can choose divorce, and that women do not posses this right. The truth, however, is quite different.Islamic law gives women the right to end a marriage just as it gives that right to men. Islamic law allows women to end a marriage in a number of ways: Women have the right to make it a condition [in the initial marital contract] that the authority to pronounce divorce be in her hands, meaning that they can divorce themselves whenever they please. In this case the woman divorces herself and is entitled to all of her rights; it is as if her husband divorced her, so she does not lose any of her rights. She can also request to be separated from her husband due to harm. If the man has inflicted great harm on his wife the judge will separate them and she will be entitled to all of her rights without exception. She can also seek khula’ . Only in this case does the woman separate herself from the man, except she waives her rights due to the fact that there is no [external] reason to end the marriage so it would be unfair to impose a fine of these dues on the man while he is still holding fast to the relationship between them.Many religious texts indicate the free choice of women when it comes to separation from their husbands. An example is that which is related by Ibn Abbas [who said], “Barira’s husband was a slave called Mughith; it is as if I can see him now following after her weeping, the tears moistening his beard. The Prophet told Abbas, ‘O Abbas, do you not marvel at the love of Mughith for Barira and the dislike of Barira for Mughith?’ So the Prophet said to her, ‘Would you take him back?’ She said, ‘O Messenger of God, are you commanding me?’ He said, ‘I only intercede.’ She said, ‘I have no need for him.’” When she understood that his words were not a command, but rather advice, she chose to leave him since that was her right after becoming free. The wife of Thabit ibn Qays came to the Prophet and said, “O Messenger of God, there is none more steadfast than Thabit when it comes to religion and morals, but I do not love him.” He said, “Will you return his garden to him?” She said, “Yes,” and gave him back his garden and his and he separated from her.This is a brief clarification of the issue of women choosing their husbands and having their desires respected if they want to leave them. According to this it is impermissible for a father, or anyone else for that matter, to force his son or daughter to marry someone they do not like; also women can end marriage in the ways mentioned.And God is Most high and Knows Best."

    "Question": "I am married to a man for five years now and I have three girls. My husband left us for five months now and I am totally alone with the kids with no financial support from him. When he came home he said he had financial problems and that his work is not stable but I discovered later that he was lying to me and that he was seeing another woman. I saw their pictures together and I went crazy and threatened him that I will file for divorce. He said that he does not want to lose me or the kids and he does not want to divorce me. So I asked him to leave this woman he is seeing and to my shock he said that he married her but illegally with no contract because he is not allowed to have officially two wives.",
    "Answer": "After reading your inquiry, I believe you answered your own questions and solved the dilemma that you have been going through for sometime now. The husband in Islam has so many responsibilities some of them are financial and others are emotional, parental, and social. From what I understood in your inquiry, your husband is not contributing financially at all in supporting his family and probably does not believe that he has to. So he scores zero at the financial front. Moving to another important aspect which is the parental one, you said that he is not contributing at all in parenting and raising his children. That makes you a single mom in disguise, officially married and solely burdened with the up keeping of your household. So again your husband scores zero on the parental front. The third aspect of his responsibilities is the emotional one. You stated that he asked to lose weight to please him. There is no objection to the fact a wife should whatever she can to please her husband but the issue should be mutual.It is unfair that he asks you to beautify yourself to please him whereas all he does is turning your life to misery. No wonder why you don’t feel happy with him as you are practically living alone separated from him emotionally and dare I say that you might be a victim of being emotionally abused. This makes him score nothing but big fat zero on the emotional front.Regarding the issue of him illegally marrying another woman and cannot maintain justice between you both in terms of quality time and money, this goes totally against the Islamic teachings as he is committing a grave injustice to you. He has no sense of responsibility and he needs a wake up call to rise up to his parental duties.I personally believe that you have the right to seek divorce because unhappy marriage leads to disastrous consequences and the ones they suffer the most are the children. Your husband is not making any efforts to lead a good example and he turns your life to a complete misery. I think you need to take matters into your own hand and have the courage to face him with his pitfalls as a husband and father. Maybe you can try to have a heart to heart conversation with him for the last time and maybe you should talk to his older relatives i.e. uncles and aunts and warn him that you will seek divorce if he didn’t change his attitude. If your words fell on deaf ears then you exhausted all means of reconciliation and you owe it to yourself and your children to move away starting a new life where they get to see their father whenever he or they want of course but without you taking the brunt of officially having a husband whereas literally you have nothing but a failed marriage.I believe you need to start to seek ways of being financially independent through having a job and move out to a new city and make friends who can support you and I advise you to supplicate to God constantly as the power of supplication is so immense that it sets things right and you would feel serenity within you and a strength to pass through this difficult time inshAllahMay Allah grant you strength, happiness and direct you always to the right path..Amen"

    "Question": "I am married to an American Muslim man and we live together in the USA. He does not spend on me except that he brings me food and he abuses me. He always threatens me with divorce and thinks low of me because I am barren. I feel that I am a total wreck and I am going through a bad emotional state. I went to a psychiatrist to relieve the pain. I can’t keep up praying all the five daily prayers because the medical treatment I take causes drowsiness and now I want to take off my hijab, would this be considered as a major sin?",
    "Answer": "God al Mighty does not cause us to bear more than we can handle and He did not bring us to the world for us to be miserable. Therefore if you are unhappy with your current marriage and find yourself unable to continue this relationship then legally it is permissible for you to seek divorce because you are not obliged to live miserably as if you are in a prison. If your husband is driving you to a miserable state where you need psychological help and you find yourself unable to keep your faith intact, then leaving him and starting a new life is the answer. You have to find your own strength and drag yourself out of this state of feebleness and surrender and instead open up your heart and search for your happiness with eagerness and determination. I would advise you to supplicate to God and seek His guidance to determine whether to continue your marriage should u only feel your comfort there or to leave your husband and seek your happiness somewhere else and rekindle your faith.As for the daily prayers, there is no legal impediment for you to leave prayers during your state of drowsiness and when you regain your consciousness, you can make up for the missed prayers. As for the hijab, it is a religious obligation on adult Muslim women and you can limit your veil to cover your hair and bosom with no excessiveness or exaggeration. The major sin that you would be committing against yourself is to leave yourself in such state of misery which leads you to the current bad state of psychological trauma and to let your life slip out of your hands. You have to regain control over your life and strengthen yourself through seeking God’s refuge and ask for His support as He is the most generous and caring. We wish you all happiness and goodness in this life and the hereafter."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6079/my-husband-beats-me-and-he-says-that-it-is-his-god-given-right-according-to-islam",
    "Question": "I am an American Muslim who converted to Islam and married a Muslim man in the US. My husband tried to convince me that in Islam the husband has the legal right to beat his wife, threaten her and terrorize his kids. I am a constant reader of the Quran and I understood that my husband’s stance is not correct. Before my conversion I was moved by the compassionate and merciful nature of Islam. Does the Shari’ah give the husband the right to beat his wife as he claims?",
    "Answer": "Islam is a religion of mercy and God described his beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in the Quran as a mercy to all the world. God says, “And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds” (21:107). The Islamic Shari’ah has placed a great emphasis on the rights of the weak, whom should be treated with mercy and compassion. The Prophet continuously emphasized that women in many situations fall under the category of the weak along with the orphans. It was reported by al–Nasai and Ibn Majah with a sound transition as Imam al Nawawi stated in his book “Riyad al- Salehin” that the Prophet said, “O God be my witness that I admonish people about disregarding the right of the two weak parties: the orphan and the woman.”The woman is in need of mercy because of the nature of her physical structure and her need for someone to take care of her affairs. For this reason, the Prophet described women to be similar to a soft glass which should be handled with gentleness and care. That is the reason behind the emphasis of Islam on dealing with the wife with kindness and care, and God reiterated that the basic building blocks of matrimony are mercy, affection and serenity. God says,“And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought” (Quran30:21). In this regard, the Prophet declared that the excellent husband is the one who shows impeccable care to his wife and utmost kindness in dealing with her. It was narrated by lady ‘Aisha that the Prophet said, “The best among you is the best towards his family and I am the best towards my family” (al- Tirmidhi). Similarly, Islam encourages leniency and softness in fixing mistakes and correcting errors. The Prophet called for softness and leniency in all affairs. Lady ‘Aisha narrated that the Prophet said, “When leniency becomes part of any matter, it beautifies it and when it is extracted from it, it mars it” (Muslim). The Prophet was an excellent example of gentleness. It was reported that lady ‘Aisha said, “The Prophet never beat any of his wives or servants; in fact, he did not strike any living being with his hand except in the cause of God and he would not avenge for himself except when the prohibitions of God had been violated, only then would he retaliate\" (Muslim).Indeed the Prophet’s noble biography provides us with an excellent manual for men on how to deal with their women. God says in the Quran, “There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of God an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in God and the Last Day and [who] remembers God often” (Quran 33:21). When it comes to the issue of beating women, it was mentioned once in the Quran when God says, “But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, God is ever Exalted and Grand” (Quran 4:34). The issue of the adamant refusal of woman to engage in consensual sexual relations with her husband is a major issue which has a social and moral impact, this is due to the wife depriving the husband of his matrimonial rights. God in turn guided the husband to try multiple alternatives to convince the wife to revive the intimate relations between them. These alternatives are designed to suit different cultural backgrounds and customary practices, one is to act delicately in regards to how these alternatives are acted upon as cultural differences exist from one woman to another. Cultural background and customary practices should be at the forefront of consideration when utilizing these various alternatives, ultimately the goal is reconciliation and the revival of strong matrimonial relationships. The husband is allowed to forsake sleeping in the same bed with his wife as a way of placing pressure on her to rethink her position, without causing her harm or directing any sort of injustice to her. The scholars allowed for the husband to abandon sleeping in the same bed with his wife with the condition of not causing any psychological pain or harm for the wife otherwise it would be impermissible to resort to this alternative. As for resorting to beating as an alternative, the scholars have unanimously agreed that beating in the verse does not mean causing harm to the wife or to diminish her dignity. The permissibility of beating is restricted to specific cases and confined to certain environments in which beating is not looked down upon as a degradation of women. In other words, beating is not an obligatory alternative at all. And even when it is necessary in certain cases to resort to it, it should not be a beating which causes harm to the wife or leaves any marks or bruises on her body. The striking should be light and soft with a toothbrush or siwak. The reason behind the beating is to show the husband’s anger and express his disapproval of the wife’s negative attitude towards him. This means that it is totally impermissible for the husband to use a tool which is specifically and deliberately designed for beating. It goes without saying that there is a colossal difference between striking with a light object like tooth brush, which causes no harm, and that of an item which causes severe harm and humiliates the woman. Although the scholars placed very strict conditions on the purpose and the tool of beating, they reiterated that resorting to this alternative should be the last option for the husband and he should have exhausted all other options before turning to beating. Also it is not permissible for the husband to abandon the matrimonial bed or resort to beating on the basis of an expected or foreseeable sign of the woman’s intention of refraining from having a sexual relationship with her husband. More importantly the scholars prohibited the husband from beating if he knows that this alternative will not help in convincing his wife and solving the problem. They also prohibited the husband from beating if he knows that there are other alternatives that he can turn to which would help in fixing the situation other than beating. Moreover, the scholars prohibited for the husband to resort to beating if he knows that even light striking would hurt his wife and leave marks on her body.Imam al Hattab al-Maliki stated in his book “Mawahib al Jalil” (4/ 15-16) that if the husband believes that the probability of fixing the situation by resorting to beating is not high, he is not allowed to beat his wife. And in the book “al-Jawahir”, it is said that if the husband believes that resorting to severe beating would be the only effective way in changing his wife’s position, he is not allowed to resort to beating at all.”The scholars stated that the husband should be beaten up and disciplined if he wronged his wife or was not mindful of her rights. Other scholars emphasized the same, and stated that beating the wife should not be done using whips or sticks or anything of the like. Beating should only be done with a siwak or with a hand to express blame and censure as stated by Ibn ‘Abbas. Also Ibn Abi Hatem narrated in his explanation of the verse of beating that al Hassan al- Basri defined the non-harmful beating as the one that does not leave any marks along with the necessity of avoiding the honored places on the body such as the face or the sensitive places such as the genital organs. This kind of light beating is permissible in the Islamic Shari’ah with strict conditions that are confined to certain cultural environments that some cultures may not be familiar with. The Quran was sent to all people from different walks of life and address people from different cultural backgrounds. One of the salient proofs that the issue of beating women as an alternative is not absolutely permissible in all times and all places, is that the Prophet prohibited beating women. And when some women came to complain that their husbands beat them up, the Prophet was angry and said that those who beat their wives are not the best among men. This means that beating is not allowed to be practiced in all cases. And the absolute prohibition of beating comes when it becomes harmful or done with the intention of revenge. Also it should only be practiced in cultural environments which consider this method as a way of showing blame and expressing dissatisfaction, and is not seen as a way of belittling women or encroaching upon her dignity and self esteem. Al- Taher ibn ‘Ashour reiterated this understanding in his Quranic exegesis “al- Tahrir w-l Tanwir” in which he explained that all of the scholastic opinions on this issue indicate meticulous awareness of people’s different cultural environments and customary practices. For example, the Bedouin culture does not consider beating women as an assault and women do not consider such an act as an affront to their dignity. In these kinds of cultures, expressing dissatisfaction of the wife in this manner is well understood by the women as a way of blaming and not as an assault.The governing authority has the right to place restrictions on the rights of husbands to use beating as an alternative. This is especially the case when men deliberately abuse this right and use it as a tool for severe beating or venting their anger and revenge which automatically lead to domestic violence that sever the amicable ties of the family. For this reason some scholars prohibited beating women altogether such as the luminary scholar al Qadi ibn ‘Arabi al Maliki who wrote in his Quranic exegesis “Ahkam al Quran” and reported that the renowned scholar ‘Atta ibn Rabah said that the husband should not beat his wife, but is only allowed to express his anger. Al Maliki among other scholars interpreted the verse to mean that the husband is only allowed to show his dissatisfaction, and that these scholars rejected the authenticity of the prophetic traditions which allow light beating. There is no doubt that severe beating, lashing and physical punishment which is called in our contemporary world as domestic violence is emphatically prohibited by the consensus of all scholars. All people should stand united against it. Practicing violence against women has nothing to do with the Islamic teachings. The Islamic legislative sources encourage mercy and compassion in the matrimonial life between the husband and the wife and do not find any justification for harming women. Therefore, the Prophet was akin to prohibit beating in all its forms and al-Bukhari reported that the Prophet said, “Would a man beat his wife like he beats his slave and then returns to have intercourse with her at the end of the day?!” In the Islamic Shari’ah the general overarching ruling is the prohibition of causing harm in all its forms. What is unfortunately happening in some Muslim societies of harming women is the result of not abiding by the merciful teachings of Islam. Also, current civil laws which stem from the Islamic Shari’ah criminalize violence against the wife and consider it harm which requires compensation for the psychological damage that was caused to the wife, along with giving her the right to seek divorce while guaranteeing her full rights. God the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "As-Salaam Alaykum,I converted to Islam in August 2012, alhamdulillah, but before that I was dating a man. We are still dating and he is not a Muslim. He supports me, takes care of me, and even though he isn't Muslim, he helps me wake up on time for Fajr. I have made dua'as asking for Allah (SWT) to guide him and to help me. I am torn and I am hurting. He hasn't done anything wrong that would give me a reason to leave him. I love him and he loves me. We plan on marriage. Is there anything I can do to make this relationship work? I don't think he will convert to Islam, so I am at a loss.",
    "Answer": "Dear sister,We offer our heartfelt congratulations on your conversion to Islam and we pray God to keep your faith steadfast.Love is a beautiful sentiment which God instills in people’s hearts to care for each other. The ultimate source of love is God Almighty and from God’s love stems all other forms of love which we see in our lives. From the Islamic perspective, there are two kinds of love. The first kind is divine love and this love has to do with the love of God, His prophets, His revealed books and His decrees. The second kind of love is the natural intrinsic love that humans have for their families, children, friends, spouses, neighbors and the world at large. The first kind of love always forms the fine base and the accurate measure for the validity and continuity of the second kind of love. For example, God emphatically commanded us to love and care for our parents, children, friends, neighbors and be kind to humans at large; this means that the second kind of love corresponds to the first kind and therefore it is a lawful love.On the other hand, when natural intrinsic love contradicts divine love, following this intrinsic love becomes more of a desire or a whim. As genuine as your love for your boyfriend is and as caring as he is for you, marriage is a different story. Marriage is all about sharing every aspect of your lives and one of these important aspects is religious inspiration and spiritual growth. There is a special bond that grows gradually between the man and his wife when he leads her in prayer and when they both share supplications to God. There is a sense of religious fulfillment which is instilled in the hearts of the couple when they attend Friday prayer together and be an active part of their religious community. When children are involved, marrying a Muslim man becomes essential as he plays a leading role in their spiritual upbringing by being a role model in praying and other religious activities which allow children to follow suit.Muslims aim at following Prophet Muhammad’s footsteps and trace his fine actions because for Muslims he is the ultimate embodiment of perfection on earth and he is our gateway to attain God’s pleasure. Reading the Prophet’s biography leaves one at awe on how gentle, caring and loving he was to all people around him, wives, children, friends and even foes. It would be totally unfair for you to ask your man to follow a Prophet that he doesn’t believe in.Love and care are important qualities in a potential husband but without compatibility and harmony in other major aspects which the couple will share; love will suffer from a major setback as the needed nutrition which keeps the flame of love ignited will eventually fade away.Marriage in Islam has a higher aim around which the couple’s lives revolve. Both parties are placing God’s content and pleasure right at the center of their lives and aim at reaching this goal through their intimate relationship with each other, through raising their children with the concept of love of the Divine, through being an active participant and a contributor in the larger society in which they live. This higher divine aim which the matrimonial relationship in Islam aims at achieving strengthen the bonds of love, mercy and compassion between the couple and this divine wave of love flows into the hearts of their children as well.From a legal perspective, It is permissible in Islam for a Muslim man to marry a non-Muslim woman (Christian or Jewish) and not vice-versa. Though this may seem unfair, the rationale behind it becomes clear if the true reason is known. All legislations in Islam are based upon certain wisdom and a definite interest to all parties involved.Marriage in Islam is based upon love, mercy and peace of mind; a family must be built upon a firm basis to guarantee the continuity of the marital relationship. Islam respects all the previous heavenly revealed religions and the belief in all the previous Prophets is an inseparable part of the Islamic creed.A Muslim man who marries a Christian or a Jewish woman, is commanded to respect her faith, and it is not permissible for him to prevent his wife from practicing the rites of her religion and going to the church or synagogue. Therefore, Islam seeks to provide the wife with her husband's respect for her religion which in turn protects the family from destruction.On the other hand, it will be unlikely for a non-Muslim to respect his Muslim wife's faith. This is because a Muslim man believes in all previous religions and Prophets of God and respects them while a non-Muslim does not believe nor acknowledges the Prophet of Islam; rather, a non-Muslim considers Prophet Mohammed a false prophet and usually believes in all the fabricated lies made against Islam and its Prophet. Even if a non-Muslim husband does not explicitly express this, a Muslim wife will constantly feel that her husband does not respect her faith. There is no room for compliments regarding this matter; it is a matter of principle. Moreover, mutual respect between spouses is a fundamental element for the continuity of their marital relationship.Islam follows its own logic when it prohibits a Muslim man from marrying a non-Muslim other than a Christian or a Jewess for the same reason it prohibits a Muslim woman from marrying a non-Muslim.A Muslim believes in only the Heavenly revealed religions; all other religions are human made. So, in the case when a Muslim woman marries a non-Muslim, the element of respect to the wife's religion will be non-existent. This will affect the marital relationship and will not achieve the love and mercy that is required in a marital relationship.We understand that not marrying the man you love is not an easy decision but knowing that God only seeks what makes you happy in both worlds and having deep faith in God’s fine judgment will make the matter easier on you God willing. Also you have to believe that God is the one who instills love in your heart and if this man is the right one for you, God will guide his heart to Islam and make him a righteous husband for you, but if your man stays adamant on his position then this would be a clear sign that he is not the one for you and you have to be assured that God will instill in your heart a new love for a man with whom you can share your life in this world and in the hereafter. Your feelings of being torn apart between God’s love and the love for the man you want to marry is a real hardship but your heart won’t find ease unless a reconciliation is made so you don’t have to choose between them anymore. May God guide you to what is best for you in this world and in the hereafter amin."

    "Question": "I am a Muslim man and I want to marry a catholic woman. I was wondering if it is permissible for us to hold our wedding ceremony in the church before heading to the mosque.",
    "Answer": "Islam is a religion of tolerance and wants from its adherents to set a good example of coexistence and harmony in dealing with the communities in which they live. It is not prohibited for a Muslim to enter a church unless something disliked is being committed. Sheikh Shehab al-Din al Ramli in his commentary on the book Asna Al-Matalib said: “It is impermissible for a Muslim to enter a church without taking a verbal or customary permission from the church they want to enter because people in the church may feel that Muslims are unwanted or unwelcome.”It is permissible to conduct a marriage contract in a church provided the contract fulfills all the necessary conditions; otherwise, the contract would be rendered invalid. It is important to note that it is impermissible to get married in a church if the ceremony involves any ritual that goes against the teachings of Islam in which case the contract would be rendered invalid.Therefore, there is no legal impediment to having your marriage in a church to please your wife and her family and to show your care and compassion for her. And God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "If a wife fought with her husband and then refused to go to bed with him, is she allowed to do so? Given that the wife refuses her husband because he wants to have a sexual relationship with her a lot and she does not desire sex as much as he does. What can she do?",
    "Answer": "The wife has sacred rights on her husband and vice versa yet legal rulings should not be used in a way in which each party search for legal evidences and prophetic traditions to prove him/her right all the way over their spouse. This approach only leads religion to work as a pressuring card on the other side to force one party to do the desire of the other party without caring much to fulfill the duties he/she has for the partner.Matrimonial life in Islam is essentially based on mercy, love and tranquility along paying extreme care and consideration for the feelings of both parties without boiling the relationship down to the mere fact of demanding rights. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught us how to lead a successful matrimonial relationship through basing it on kindness, gentleness and care between spouses. This means that the husband should be caring and understanding to his wife’s hard chores at home and how tiring, daunting and exhausting running home errands could be. He has to be helpful, merciful and loving to his wife. The wife from her side has to show love to her husband and understand that intimate relationship with her husband increases their bond of love and care and preventing her husband from enjoying intimate time with her means that she closes the door of lawful pleasure for her husband. Also the wife should not make her husband feel that he is the last item down the list of her interests. The spark of love between the couple needs to remain ignited through love, mercy and kindness which will enable them to lead a happy marriage."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to marry a paternal uncle's ex-wife, taking into account that the mother of the person who wants to marry was previously married to this uncle, and that this uncle had fathered children from both women?",
    "Answer": "A paternal uncle's wife is not from among those who become unmarriageable due to lineage or nursing. The seven categories of women to whom one is prohibited to marry due to lineage are mentioned in Surat an-Nisaa`. Allah says,Prohibited to you [for marriage] are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father's sisters, your mother's sisters, your brother's daughters, your sister's daughters, your [milk] mothers who nursed you, your sisters through nursing, your wives' mothers, and your step-daughters under your guardianship [born] of your wives unto whom you have gone in. But if you have not gone in unto them, there is no sin upon you. And [also prohibited are] the wives of your sons who are from your [own] loins, and that you take [in marriage] two sisters simultaneously, except for what has already occurred. Indeed, Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful. [Al-Nisaa`, 23]In addition to the above the prohibition extends to step-mothers and any other woman who becomes unmarriageable through nursing. Hence, an uncle's wife is not from among the women prohibited in marriage. There is no harm if the mother of this person who wants to marry his uncle's second ex-wife, was previously married to his uncle.The rulingIt is permissible for the inquirer to marry his uncle's ex-wife as long as there is no other obstacle to the marriage such as nursing relations, or any other such reason.

    "Question": "Is it permissible to marry my sister-in-law 48 days after my wife's death?",
    "Answer": "It is permissible to marry your sister-in-law since the prohibition only concerns marrying two sisters simultaneously. Allah the Almighty said about prohibitions in marriage:\"And [also prohibited are] … that you take [in marriage] two sisters simultaneously …\" [Qur`an 4:23]Therefore, if a wife passes away, it is permissible for her widower to marry her sister without waiting for any time to elapse.According to the opinion of the majority of scholars, in the event the wife is irrevocably divorced, her divorcee may marry her sister without waiting for his ex-wife's 'idda [waiting period after divorce] to end. Hanafi scholars, on the other hand, maintained that a man is to wait for the 'idda to end before marrying her sister."

    "Question": "Is my mother's aunt i.e. my maternal grandmother's sister, from among those to who marriage is prohibited? Does it make a difference whether or not she is my grandmother's full sister?",
    "Answer": "It is established in Islamic law that women to who marriage is prohibited for reasons of blood relations or relations through marriage include descendants and ancestors if they are once removed. These include paternal and maternal aunts, whether they are one's paternal or maternal aunts. The same prohibition applies to both a mother's and father's sisters and on up due to the words of Allah the Almighty Who says,Prohibited to you (for marriage) are:--Your mothers, daughters, sisters; father's sisters, mother's sisters …[An-Nisaa`, 23] This is because there is a consensus that the words 'father's sisters' includes a father's sister and a grandfather's sister no matter how high up. And the words 'mother's sister' include a mother's sister and a grandmother's sister no matter how high up (Family Law by Mohammed Mohyi Ad-Deen Abdul-Hamid.

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6065/is-fulfilling-sexual-desire-the-sole-reason-for-marriage-in-islam",
    "Question": "Assalam alaykum",
    "Answer": "Marriage in Islam is based on mercy and compassion. The term mercy (Ar. rahmah) is an all encompassing term which includes love, intimacy, care, respect, kindness and gentleness. God says in the Quran, “And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.” 30:21These gentle feelings of love and care which are instilled in the hearts of the couple are divinely inspired and marriage comes as a celebration of their love. For this reason Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said “I don’t see for the lovers except marriage” because marriage is the gateway through which the instilled love in the hearts of the couple is nourished. One of the expressions of love and closeness between the married couple is sexual intimacy which has a higher meaning than merely fulfilling one’s sexual desire as this act of love draws the couple nearer together and higher levels of love springs in their hearts.Marriage in Islam has a higher aim around which the couple’s lives revolve. Both parties are placing God’s content and pleasure right at the center of their lives and aim at reaching this goal through their intimate relationship with each other, through raising their children with the concept of love of the Divine, through being an active participant and a contributor in the larger society in which they live. This higher divine aim which the matrimonial relationship in Islam aims at achieving strengthen the bonds of love, mercy and compassion between the couple and this divine wave of love flows into the hearts of their children as well. In other words, marriage is all about sharing every aspect of your lives and one of these important aspects is religious inspiration and spiritual growth. There is a special bond that grows gradually between the man and his wife when he leads her in prayer and when they both share supplications to God. There is a sense of religious fulfillment which is instilled in the hearts of the couple when they attend Friday prayer together and be an active part of their religious community.Therefore, it would be totally unfair to say that marriage is merely about fulfilling sexual desires of both parties as boiling down the value of marriage to such mere physical act is a false representation of what marriage is all about and what it aims to achieve. When the Prophet said that by getting married the man has fulfilled his half religion, he meant that God bestowed on him a soul mate with which he can enjoy sexual pleasure without being tempted to fall into prohibited fornication and the same concept applies on women too. Therefore both parties become the safe haven for each other to enjoy sexual pleasure and share intimate love.In your case you are still a student and lack the financial resources to get married and therefore the Prophet advised the youth who are yet unable to get married to keep fasting and not to eat much in order to decrease the sexual drive. Also occupying yourself with beneficial actions and keeping your day busy is a good way to drive your mind away from sexual thoughts. Finally keeping your spiritual spark ignited through continuous invocation of God and constant salutations to His Prophet will calm you down and drive you away from erotic thoughts.When the time comes and you find a good girl who you fall in love with, you will realize that what holds you both together is way stronger than simply fulfilling your sexual desire. May God keep you safe and guide your heart to what is best for you in this world and in the hereafter amin."

    "Question": "When a woman commits fornication and weds her lover, does the sin of fornication remain or is it removed simply because they marry?",
    "Answer": "Fornication is one of the enormities the sin of which is removed by repentance. It is not a condition for repentance that the fornicator marries his lover. Rather, repentance is by desisting from such an act, regretting committing it, and resolving never to return to it again. Allah forgives whoever repents whether or not he marries his lover; repentance is not bound to marriage even if decency demands protecting the woman with whom he has erred. If both of them repent and are suitable for each other, then it is preferable that they marry each other.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "A woman was engaged to a person working overseas. When he wanted to conduct the marriage, he requested the name of one of her relatives and sent him an official power of attorney so that he would conduct the contract on his behalf. The marriage was conducted after the bride commissioned her maternal uncle to enact her marriage contract. When the marriage official went to register the contract, the court refused to notarize it because it was conducted by means of a general power of attorney, which is not valid for conducting a marriage contract. The marriage official asked the grantor to send a limited power of attorney specific to conducting a marriage contract or to come in person to conduct the marriage contract. The groom, however, refused to execute a limited power of attorney with the excuse that he does not have the time, and said he will return to effect the marriage himself. When he did return during his vacation, he did not go to the marriage official and kept postponing performing the contract in person and furnishing the marital house. Moreover, he went so far as to ask for his rights as a husband. When the bride requested that they separate amicably, he replied that he would leave her without a divorce, and then traveled.Is she a wife to this man, or is the marriage not even valid—especially since she does not have a legal marriage document or anything else to prove that she is his wife?",
    "Answer": "This marriage contract is invalid because it does not include a power of attorney specific to conducting a marriage. The type of power of attorney used in the above scenario is a general one for handling financial transactions and their like. It is established in Islamic law that a power of attorney has four integrals: the commissioner, the commissioned, the authorized actions, and the verbal phrase (the offer to act as a proxy and its acceptance). A power of attorney specific to conducting a marriage contract must mention the subject of the proxy which is conducting the marriage contract. Islamic law protects honor and good reputation more than it does anything else.The rulingThis contract is invalid and therefore does not accrue any of the effects of a marriage contract. You are not his wife, as he claims, and he has no power over you."

    "Question": "Dear Sheikh,",
    "Answer": "When I read your letter, I understood that the source of your confusion is not your love for your cousin but rather your misunderstanding of the concept of love in Islam. You have started your letter by saying that “if I love anything or anyone other than God, I will be punished by it”, this statement of yours is phrased in the wrong way because your statement simply means that we are not allowed to love our parents, spouses, families, friends, neighbors, humans or animals or anything for that matter as all things fall under “other than God”. The correct statement is that “if we love anything or anyone more than God then this would be wrong”.Before going any further we have to differentiate between two kinds of love. The first kind is natural love which is instilled in our hearts and this includes love for one self, family, spouses, friends, neighbors along with other inclinations towards certain food types, colors, movie choices, pet kinds etc…The second type of love is the love for God, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the divine law which includes a list of rulings of permissions and prohibitions towards certain things. When natural love goes against divine love, we should not favor the former over the latter. Love of God, his Prophet and the divine law should take precedence over other types of natural love and the reason for this is because naturally humans fall captives to what they love and to whom they love. Therefore we should be very careful to whom or to what we give the reins of our heart. For example, love between men and women are natural and no sane person can deem it prohibited but channeling this love outside the wedlock is prohibited in Islam and for this reason if someone chose to favor his natural love feeling towards the one he or she loves over the love of God who prohibited proceeding in this relationship outside matrimonial ties then this love is prohibited.This is the meaning of the verse in which God says, “Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight ... are more loved to you than God and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His Cause , then wait until God brings about His Decision (torment). And God guides not the people who are disobedient to God). (9:24)This means that as long as your love for your cousin does not lead you to commit anything which goes against your love for God by disobeying Him or transgressing against His laws, then there should be no prohibition there. Love is a natural beautiful sentiment that God instills in the heart of people to have the ability to love one another. The rule of thumb in this issue is that the love of God and Prophet Muhammad takes precedence over other kinds of love so it should act as an umbrella under which other kinds of love nourish. God says in the Quran, “Say (O Muhammad to mankind): \"If you (really) love God then follow me and God will love you and forgive you of your sins. And God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\""

    "Question": "I live in France and I want to marry a good Muslim girl but the problem is that I was in a relationship with her mother for a long time. So am I allowed to marry the girl?",
    "Answer": "This is one of the debatable issues among scholars. The Hanafi jurists for example believe that committing adultery with the mother automatically prohibits marrying the daughter and vice versa. As for both the Shafi’i and Maliki scholars, they believe that prohibited acts do not prohibit lawful ones. This means that it is permissible for the man who committed adultery with a woman then repented and cut off the relationship to marry the woman’s daughter or mother.We believe that the whole matter is based on deterring the act of committing adultery and this issue differs according to differences in societies and the nature of the relationship among people. Therefore if marrying the daughter will lead to even the slightest possibility of resuming adultery between the man and the mother then the Hanafi fatwa of prohibiting this marriage prevails to deter the possibility of committing adultery. But if the prohibited relationship between the man and the mother ceased indefinitely and that both parties are adamant on refraining from resuming such prohibited relationship then there is no legal impediment to adopt the opinions of the Malikis and the Shafi’is which permit marrying the daughter of a mother with whom adultery was committed."

    "Question": "I conduct marriage contracts at the house of either the groom or the bridegroom in front of their families and a limited number of people. After the contract, the marriage is publicized in the mosque by repeating the marriage formula in front of an audience and guests. Some people object to this on the pretext that the Prophet did not practice it.",
    "Answer": "The marriage formula indicates a propositional statement rather than a performative or declarative one. However, it was necessary to shift the meaning to convey declaration for the purpose of effecting the marriage contract and so the meaning of the words would reflect the external reality of the performance of the marriage contract, and not a simple declaration to which the possibility of falsehood may be attached. Formulating contracts is an important and valid objective that requires replacing the propositional nature of the formula (the default) with the declarative/performative one. If, after conducting the marriage contract, the marriage formula is repeated once more (in its default propositional sense) to indicate that the event has indeed occurred, this is both linguistically correct and permissible in Islamic law. Such an instance may include the bride's guardian telling her husband, \"I have given my charge to you in marriage,\" and the husband answering, \"I have accepted\" whereby both intend to inform of a past event and not formulate a new contract. In light of this interpretation, the meaning of the bride's guardian's words would be, \"I have given my charge to you in marriage since …\" and the meaning of her husband's words would be, \"I have accepted [your offer] from that time.\" There is no legal objection to this.Claiming that the repetition of the marriage formula is impermissible on the pretext that the Prophet did not practice it is unsound. This is because the non-existence of evidence that the Prophet refrained from a certain act does not mean that he did not actually practice it. Even if we were to assume that the Prophet did not perform this act, this does not necessarily mean that it is impermissible. In the principles of Islamic law, it is invalid to maintain the impermissibility of the acts which the Prophet did not perform.The rulingBased on the above, the practice mentioned in the question is valid and permissible in Islamic law.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6090/should-i-ask-my-future-wife-if-she-is-virgin-or-not",
    "Question": "Salaam alaikum, is it permissible to ask, when proposing for marriage, if the other person is a virgin? I was always told that asking such a thing is not permissible because it encourages people to lie about committing zinna or to reveal their sins, but I've seen no evidence either way so I thought I'd ask for clarification.",
    "Answer": "It was reported by Abu Dawud and Al Nasai that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said that God loves modesty and cover up of pitfalls. A lot of textual doctrines were keen on establishing the idea of concealment of mistakes and refraining from disseminating scandals as we should not do to people what we don’t want to be done to ourselves. Prophet Muhammad also said “whoever did not declare the errors of a Muslim, God will not declare his errors on the day of judgment”. On the other hand, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) warned those who are in pursuit of spreading scandals and digging for people’s pitfalls that they will in turn be subjected to such pursuit by others.It was narrated through Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet climbed up the stairs of the pulpit and called out loud saying “O those who embraced Islam with your tongue and its flow did not reach your heart yet. Don’t inflict harm on Muslims, don’t belittle them and don’t pursue and dig for their pitfalls as whoever digs for the pitfalls of others, God will dig for his own pitfalls and declare it before people…” (al Tirmidhi).When a Muslim falls into an error or sin through committing an act of disobedience to God, he is obliged to conceal it and not to declare it before others because the Islamic law did not set legal punishments as a precondition for accepting repentance. It was narrated through Zayd ibn Aslam that a man confessed before the Prophet of committing adultery. The Prophet asked for a whip and the man was whipped then the Prophet said, “O people it is about time to stay away from God’s punishment. Whoever commits any of this filth should conceal it and take shield in the concealment of God as whoever confesses to us will face God’s punishment”. Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said “all my Ummah is saved except those who brag about their sins. Among the forms of bragging is a man who would commit a sin at night and then wakes up with God’s grace of concealment yet he brags among people saying “I have done so and so last night”. He would spend the night with God’s grace of concealment and wakes up revealing God’s concealment of his sins.Abu Dawud reported through Nu’aym ibn Hazal that Ma’ez ibn Malik was an orphan who was raised by Ibn Hazal and he committed adultery with a girl from the neighborhood so when Ibn Hazal knew he asked Ma’ez to go and tell Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to supplicate to God to forgive him. So Ma’ez confirmed the story four times and was adamant on confession so the Prophet applied corporeal punishment on him and then looked at Ibn Hazal and said “If you had concealed his sin and covered him with your clothes, it would have been better”. The Prophet’s companions and our righteous ancestors grasped this great meaning of the importance of concealment and not declaring sins and successfully applied this meaning in different incidents. For example when Ma’ez ibn Malik al Aslami came over to Abu Bakr and told him about committing adultery so Abu Bakr told him “Did you mention this to anyone else?” Ma’ez replied in negative so Abu Bakr said in reply, “repent to God and conceal yourself with His concealment as God accepts repentance from his servants”. But Ma’ez was not satisfied with Abu Bakr’s answer so he went to ‘Umar ibn al Khattab and told him about what he did so ‘Umar asked him “Did you mention this to anyone else?” and Ma’ez replied in negative so ‘Umar said in reply, “repent to God and conceal yourself with His concealment as God accepts repentance from his servants”. But Ma’ez was still not satisfied so he went over to the Prophet and admitted committing adultery and the Prophet in turn went away but Ma’ez was adamant on confessing and when the Prophet saw his insistence, he investigated the matter and when he became sure that Ma’ez committed the incident, he applied corporeal punishment on him. (Bukhari and Muslim)Al Hafiz ibn Hajar in his book (Fath al Bari) commented on this incident saying that whoever is subjected to similar incidents should repent to God and conceal himself and should not mention it to anyone as Abu Bukar and ‘Umar suggested for Ma’ez. Also whoever knows about the incident should not declare it to others and should conceal it. Moreover he is not allowed to report his case to the ruler as the Prophet said “if you had covered him with your clothes, it would have been better”. For this reason, Imam al Shafi’i came up with a ruling that whoever has committed a sin and God concealed his sin from people, then he should conceal himself and repent”.‘Abdel Razaq in his book narrated the story of a man whose daughter was betrothed to someone and that she committed adultery with someone else so the father of the bride came over to ‘Umar ibn al Khattab and mentioned the incident so ‘Umar asked in reply “what have you seen from her behavior?” so the father replied, “I haven’t seen any bad thing” so ‘Umar replied back “then permit her to get married and don’t tell anyone”.It was also reported through al She’bi that a man came to ‘Umar ibn al Khattab saying “O commander of the faithful, I had a daughter which I was a bout to bury alive in the pre Islamic era but I saved her from death and she became a good Muslim but then she committed adultery. We suddenly saw her taking a knife and trying to kill herself, I saved her and cured her wounds and she was recovered nicely. Now a man came to propose to her, should I mention to him what she has done?” so ‘Umar said in reply, “no and if you tell him, I will punish you for it”.All these stories indicate that ‘Umar favors the issue of concealment of sins of the adulterer and that we should not close the doors of mercy and repentance and allow people to pass shameful judgments on her and her family. One should rather conceal what the adulterer committed and not spread it among people. The adulterer in turn should open a new page and begin it with repentance and deserting sins.The Hanafis have stated explicitly that a virgin who loses her virginity by fornicating in secret (which means that it has not been made known to the court and resulted in punishment) or does not do it repeatedly so it becomes a habit, is legally a virgin even though she is not truly a virgin. She is married as a virgin; she is even not asked to verbally consent to marriage since she is given the same status as that of a virgin, whom the Prophet says said: “Consent is sought from Virgins. Their consent is in remaining silent.”The Hanafis state that the rational cause here is that asking for her verbal consent would expose her shameful deed, while the Shari‘ah recommends concealment. In the same chapter and section, Nasb al-Rayah includes: Abu Hanifah, may Allah grant him mercy, holds that if people know her as a virgin, they will chastise her if she consents verbally. Thus, she refrains; silence suffices so she is not cut off from her interestsAs for the objection that when the woman loses her hymn, it is considered a deficiency and patching it would be some sort of cheating is an invalid claim in Islamic law. Islamic law prohibited cheating in marriage and in other subjects but not the concealment of all kinds of deficiencies is considered cheating. The influential deficiency depends on the subject of discussion.As for generally saying that the concealment of all sorts of deficiencies is considered cheating is a corrupted opinion because if we did not put certain limits which would define influential deficiency, the term would be undefined and in turn different people can define the influential deficiencies according to their own personal opinions because what someone sees as a deficiency can be highly praised by another. According to this understanding, the woman is obliged to speak about her scars or small wounds which is totally invalid thinking and utterly rejected in Islamic law. Therefore the influential deficiency in marriage is related to pretending that something which is intended for itself exists but in reality does not exist or related to concealing a deficiency which jeopardize the purpose of marriage.An example for the first case is when the woman makes hair extension to conceal the loss of her hair to deceive her future husband. This means that the woman pretends the existence of her hair which is intended for itself and this is prohibited in Islamic law. For this reason the Shafi’I scholars permitted for women to make hair extension with the permission of her husband to eliminate the possibility of cheating or concealing a deficiency. This means that pretending the existence of something which is not intended for itself is not cheating.Virginity is not intended for itself and jurists have mentioned it in their books as one of the qualities of perfection and therefore its loss does not place it as an influential deficiency because its loss does not jeopardize or undermine the purpose of marriage.As for the claim of some men that they have to know if their future wife has fell into a sin or not is a corrupted opinion as it promotes declaring sins, revealing what God concealed, pursuing people’s pitfalls, and thinking ill of people which are all prohibited in Islamic law.As a matter of fact, there is no relationship between the loss of virginity and between adultery as this relationship only existed due to some cultures which do not see any problem when the man commits adultery whereas when the woman commits the same crime she is stained with shame and disgrace."

    "Question": "Salam alaykum,I have introduced a man to my family,he has paid the first gift but I realized I never loved him and I always shout at him.is it wrong to leave him and find someone I love? Because I pray for paradise and A̶̲̥̅ woman's paradise is loving her husband and being obedient to him. Ma asalam",
    "Answer": "The period of engagement in Islam is designed for the two parties to get to know one another and to be familiar with each other’s personal traits and characteristics. It is also a period for experiencing intellectual, social and cultural compatibility. More importantly during this period the seeds of love are sewn in the hearts of the two parties. Having regular quarrels and fights between couples in this period could be an indicative sign of the lack of understanding and harmony between them. Marriage in Islam is based on compassion and mercy between the two couple and this sound base would be hard to achieve if the couple are not in love in the first place. At the time of the Prophet, a woman came over to the Prophet asking for divorce from her husband. So the Prophet questioned about her complaint and she said that she did not complain from anything except that she did not love him and did not wish to remain in wedlock. The prophet respected her request and she was divorced in turn. Another incident was about a woman who divorced her husband and her ex husband used to walk behind her in streets crying out of love for her. So Prophet Muhammad felt sorry for him and talked to her about her ex husband’s plea of returning back to her. The woman asked the Prophet if this was a request or simply an intercession so the prophet confirmed the latter and in turn the woman said “I have no use of my ex husband”. The prophet respected her final decision and all these incidents indicate the importance of love as a solid base for marriage.Based on your question, you have no feelings of love for your fiancée and you both have a lack of understanding of each other as your continuous fights indicate, it would be better off for you both to leave each other instead of establishing a relationship on false base that is likely to fall apart sooner or later.If you decided to leave him, it would be appropriate to return back to him his gifts and find another spouse who can meet the expectation of both your mind and heart."

    "Answer": "1- The Shria'ah has made corresponding rights and duties for both spouses, and while it has made it obligatory upon the wife to remain in the marital house, it has made it obligatory upon the husband to support her within the limits his finances allow. If she has received her advanced marriage payment, she is then commanded [by Allah] to remain in the marital house and not leave without her husband's permission except in the circumstances wherein a wife is permitted to go out such as visiting her parents once every week.If the wife leaves the marital house and then refuses to return without having an excuse, she is then considered recalcitrant and is not entitled to financial support as of that date.2- The basic rule when a woman travels is that she be accompanied by a mahram as attested to by the hadith narrated by Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) who said: \"A woman must not travel unless she is accompanied by a mahram, and no man is to enter into her company unless when she is accompanied by a mahram\" [Muslim and Bukhari].However, some jurists permit a woman to travel alone if the way and destination are safe. They base their opinion on the hadith narrated by 'Adi Ibn Hatem (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet told him: \"If you live a long life, you will surely see a woman traveling from Hira till she circumambulates the Ka'bah — fearing no one except Allah\" [Bukhari].Imam Ahmad's version of the hadith includes: \"I swear by He in whose hands is my soul: verily Allah will bring this matter [the religion of Islam] into completion till a woman travels from Hira and circumambulates the Ka'bah without being accompanied by anyone\".The reason they give for the cause of the prohibition in the first hadith is when the journey is not safe and there is a lack of security. One can follow this opinion because of its facilitation and convenience. However, this is restricted by the husband's approval (if she is married), or her guardian's (if she is not).

[Qur`an 46:15]And, Mothers may breastfeed their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing [period].[Qur`an 2:233]Since the above verses demonstrate that the nursing and weaning period is twenty four months (as stated in the second verse) and the gestation and nursing period is thirty months (as stated in the first verse), then this indicates that the minimum gestation period is six months.The above answers the question and Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling for a wife who refuses to give her husband his conjugal rights? Is she considered a rebellious wife and is she entitled to waiting period expenses, alimony and her deferred dowry?",
    "Answer": "Scholars maintain that a wife who disobeys her husband without an excuse or legal cause is blameworthy and commits a great sin. This is because of a husband's great right over his wife and her obligation to obey him. 'Adbul-Rahman ibn 'Awf, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet [pbuh] said: \"If a wife observes her five daily prayers, fasts her month of Ramadan, maintains her chastity and obeys her husband, on the Day of Judgment she will be told, 'Enter Paradise from whichever gate you wish' \" [Reported by Ahmed].Scholars deduced the prohibition of a wife refusing her husband's bed from the words of the Prophet [pbuh] which state: \"If a woman spends the night refusing her husband's bed, the angels will curse her until morning\" [Muslim and Bukhari]. Therefore, a woman must obey her husband concerning his rights over her and in matters that do not call for disobeying Allah. The rights of a rebellious wife are forfeitedBy refusing her husband's bed without a legal excuse, a wife is considered rebellious and thus forfeits her right to marital [financial] support. As for her right to waiting period expenses and alimony, these depend upon the circumstances of the divorce. If she is the one who sought divorce, waiving some or all of her rights, then she does not receive those rights from among the waiting period expenses, alimony and deferred bridal payment that she has waived. Allah Almighty says: \"It is not lawful for you to take back anything you have given [your wives], except where both fear that they cannot maintain [the marriage] within the bounds set by God: if you [arbiters] suspect that the couple may not be able to do this, then there will be no blame on either of them if the woman opts to give something for her release. Those are the bounds set by God: do not overstep them. It is those who overstep God's bounds who are doing wrong.\" [Qur`an 2:229]If the husband is the one who initiated divorce and the wife did not waive any of her rights, then she is entitled to receive them.

    "Question": "What is the ruling for a man is married to four wives simultaneously and divorces one of them with a revocable divorce on the first day of the month? Is it permissible for him to take another wife other than the one he divorced? Does a man observe a waiting period after divorce or must he wait until the waiting period of the wife he divorced ends before remarrying so as not to violate the juristic rule which states that it is impermissible for a man to combine between five wives in marriage?",
    "Answer": "It is impermissible for a man who is married to four wives to take a fifth except if he divorces one of them and her waiting period ends so as not to combine between five or more wives in marriage.Combining wives during a divorcee's waiting period is tantamount to combining them in marriage. This is because the waiting period after a divorce entails the same rulings in respect to conjugal relations.The RulingIt is impermissible for a man to take a fifth wife when one of his other four wives is still in her waiting period since he would then be combining between five wives.The answer to the question is known from the above and Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "My husband passed away; he had [previously] written a registry of furnishings in the marital house and which included some grams of gold in my name. What is the ruling for this gold: is it to be estimated at its going price or its price when the registry was written? What is the ruling for the deferred bridal gift and the furnishings in the marital house?",
    "Answer": "The deferred bridal gift is a deferred debt owed by the husband to his wife, payable when the first of either divorce or the death of either spouse occurs. The wife is entitled to all the furnishings in the marital house including the electric appliances except for the husband's personal belongings such as his books, clothes, and weapons. All of these must be deducted from the estate before it is distributed among the inheritors; they are not included in the husband's estate because Allah Almighty says: [In all cases, the distribution comes] after payment of any bequests or debts [4:11]. These articles are either a debt owed by the husband to his wife or her exclusive right and she inherits her legal share of her husband's estate. The gold included in the registry of furnishings is a debt owed by the husband to his wife which she is to receive in weight.Based on this and in reference to the question, you are entitled to the entire sum of your deferred bridal gift, all the furnishings in the marital house except for the aforementioned articles, and the gold written in the registry of furnishings (in weight) or its value at the going price and not its price at the time the registry was written.Allah Most High knows best."

    "Question": "I have a sister who passed away leaving four daughters. She has full brothers and sisters. She made a verbal will leaving the inheritance to her daughters. What is the ruling of Islamic law concerning this will and how is the estate to be divided?",
    "Answer": "The four daughters of the deceased receive an obligatory share of two thirds of the estate which is to be divided equally among them. This is because of their number and because of the non-existence of a male sibling. The siblings of the deceased receive the remaining one third, with each male receiving the equivalent portion of two females because they are universal heirs, due to the absence of any other person deserving an obligatory share and to the absence of a closer universal heir.This only holds if the matter is indeed as mentioned in the question and if the deceased does not have heirs other than those mentioned in the question or other descendants who deserve an obligatory bequest.The verbal willIf all of the deceased's siblings unanimously acknowledge the verbal will made by the deceased in favor of her daughters, then it obligatory upon them to implement it from all of their shares within one third of the estate. Any portion in excess of one third of the estate becomes binding by those who give permission for the excess but not by those who refuse to authorize it. However if all of the deceased's siblings refuse to acknowledge the verbal will, then it is of no consequence and is considered as non-existent. If only some of the siblings acknowledge the will, then only those who acknowledged it may execute it from their shareand this must be only within one third of the estate except if the consenting party wishes to give away a greater portion of his share.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "A man passed away. His survivors include a wife, two daughters, three paternal brothers and two paternal sisters. Is the wife entitled to take her deferred bridal wealth before dividing up the estate?",
    "Answer": "It is established in Islamic jurisprudence that there are rights associated to estate division are of different degrees; some are stronger than others. These are classified as follows:1- Preparing the body for burialThis includes expenses for preparing the body i.e. washing and shrouding, burial expenses, and other necessary matters that must not be executed with stinginess or extravagance. These expenses are deducted before anything else because they cannot be delayed; they must be hastened to honor the deceased. 2- Paying outstanding debtsDebts owed by the deceased must be paid, especially financial obligations due on the property itself and which are verified by either acknowledgment or proof. These debts must be paid before dividing the estate to absolve the deceased of his obligation.Debts owed to Allah:• Ibn hazm and al-Shafi'i: These debts, such as zakat and kaffara [En. expiation], take precedence over debts owed to others. • The Hanafis: Debts owed to Allah are waived with death. In Hanafi jurisprudence, the heirs are not required to pay the debts of the deceased unless they volunteer to do so or if the deceased includes the request in his will in which case, the request is tantamount to a bequest to a non-relative. It must be deducted by the inheritors or executors of the bequest from one third of the property after preparing the body for burial and paying the debts.• Debts are given precedence over bequests even though they are mentioned after bequests in the Quranic verse:… after any bequest they [may have] made or debt [An-Nisa`, 12].The reason is because paying a debt is obligatory while a making a bequest is a [voluntary] donation. It is necessary to give precedence of the obligatory over a donation.It has been reported in a non-prophetic tradition that Ali ibn abu Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"You read [in the Qur`an] the bequest before you read [the will for paying] debts. The prophet ordered that debts be paid before bequests.\"3- The bequestIt is to be executed from the remaining one third of the estate after preparing the body of the deceased for burial and after paying his debts. If the bequest is more than one third of the estate, permission for this excess must be sought from the inheritors if the recipient of the bequest is a non-relative. If the bequest to an inheritor is in excess of one third of the property of the deceased, permission must be sought from the rest of the inheritors. 4- Division of the estateAfter implementing the above, the estate of the deceased is divided according to the rules laid down by Allah Almighty.RulingThe deferred bridal wealth is a debt owed by the husband to his wife payable when the first of either divorce or death takes place. In this scenario, the deferred bridal wealth is to be deducted from the estate and given to the wife in full before dividing it.Allah Almighty knows best."

The club organized a soccer game in his honor the proceeds of which will go to his family i.e. his wife and two unmarried daughters who are still undergoing their studies and who do not receive a pension. Please inform us of the following:• The manner of dividing the proceeds of the game.• If his parents are entitled to receive [anything] from it.• Whether they are only entitled to share in the employee benefits offered by the club.",
    "Answer": "It is established in Islamic law that an inheritance includes the property that a person leaves behind after his death and rights owed to him during his lifetime. The death of a person is the reason behind his heirs' entitlement to shares in his estate. Therefore, the time of death is the deciding factor in establishing whether a property is considered an inheritance or otherwise. Whatever the deceased owned before his death constitutes the inheritance after deducting any debts and bequests. What his family and relatives are entitled to after his death is not considered an inheritance and is the exclusive right of those for whom it is intended. This is because it was not owned by the deceased before his death.The ruling• The financial rights of the deceased owed by the club and to which he was entitled before his death constitutes an inheritance to all his heirs—each according to his share.• Other rights allotted to the family and children of the deceased after his death belong solely to the designated recipients. The rest of the heirs who were not included in this allocation do not receive a share of the proceeds even if the game was intended as a tribute to the deceased.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Answer": "Concerning a wife's inheritance from her husband, Allah the Almighty says, In what ye leave; their share is a fourth, if ye leave no child.[An-Nisaa`: 12]Because the contract confirms that a couple is indeed married to one another, this is true of those who have conducted the marriage contract but did not consummate the marriage.The deferred dowry is a deferred debt owed by the husband to his wife.

    "Id": 6101,
    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/6101/the-ruling-of-using-birth-control",
    "Question": "What is the ruling of using birth control?",
    "Answer": "There are two principle sources for rulings in Islam: the Holy Qur’an and the honorable Prophetic sunna. This is indicated in the words of the Messenger : I have left you two things which, if you hold on to them, you will never go astray: the Book of Allah and my sunna. They will not part until passing over the trough on the Day of Judgment.1Through comprehensively reading the verses of the Noble Qur’an we notice that is no text explicitly prohibits reducing or preventing the possibility of conception. Rather, what it does include is that maintaining progeny is a necessary objective in legal rulings. However, the Sahih and other books of hadith mention narrations permitting ‘azl [coitus interruptus, also known as withdrawal or the pull out method], meaning that the man ejaculates his semen outside his wife’s vagina after sexual penetration but before orgasm. Muslim relates that Jaber bin ‘Abdullah said: We practiced ‘azl during the time of the Messenger , when the Qur‘an was being revealed.2 Muslim relates: We practiced ‘azl during the time of the Messenger . [News of] this reached the Prophet and did not forbid it.Legists have held different opinions on the permissibility and offensiveness of ‘azl (according to what was described above) as method of contraception and limiting the number of offspring. Imam al-Ghazali writes in his book Ihya’ ‘Ulum al-Din, in the section concerning the etiquette of marriage, concerning the ruling of ‘azl, that scholars have held four different opinions concerning its permissibility and offensiveness: some permit ’azl in all instances; some prohibit it in all instances; others permit it only when the wife consents; while others permit its practice with slave girls but not with the wives who are free of slavery. al-Ghazali then says: “the valid opinion with us [meaning the Shafi‘i school] is that it is permissible.\" Legists from the various schools have almost reached an agreement that ‘azl, i.e. attempting to prevent the husband’s sperm from reaching his wife’s ovum, is permissible with the couple’s mutual agreement. It is not permissible for either of them to practice it without the other’s agreement. The evidence for this being permissible is what has been mentioned in the books of Prophetic hadith: that the Companions practiced ’azl with their wives and slave-girls during the time of the Messenger , and that news of this reached him and he did not forbid it 3.If this be so, the permissibility of birth control does not contradict the Prophetic texts since it is analogous to ‘azl which was performed and permissible during the time of the Messenger of Allah - just as Imam Muslim has mentioned in a narration from Jabir bin ‘Abdullah, who said: “We practiced ‘azl during the time of the Messenger , when the Qur‘an was being revealed,\" Bukhari included a narration in his Sahih. The objective of family planning - following this meaning - is: spacing out pregnancies, preserving the mother’s health, protecting her against numerous harm resulting from frequent pregnancies and sequential deliveries, or allowing the mother time to devote herself to raising her existing offspring. However, it is mentioned in al-Ghazali’s Ihya’ ‘Ulum al-Din and al-Shawkani’s Nayl al-Awtar that matters which promote using ‘azl include looking after the interest of an infant and fearing pregnancy while nursing, avoiding having many children, and avoiding having them in the first place. However, birth control as a permanent means of ending the possibility of conception contradicts Islam and its objective of preserving human procreation until whatever time Allah sees fit. Allah says: Do not kill your children for fear of poverty—We shall provide for them and for you. [17:31]This does not contradict the opinion of the majority of Muslim legists who have stated that it is permissible to use ‘azl to delay pregnancy, or temporarily suspending it for a legitimate reason; since this verse concerns forbidding infanticide. Prevention of pregnancy by preventing fertilization, which is the first step in an embryo’s formation, is not considered murder since the embryo will not yet have been formed if ‘azl has been used and the husband’s sperm has not reached the wife’s ovum, since the sperm and egg have not changed and passed through the developmental stages mentioned - and Allah knows best - when Allah says: We created man from an essence of clay, then we placed him as a drop of fluid in a safe place. [23:12-13]This is further clarified by a hadith narrated by ‘Abdullah bin Mas‘ud who said that the Messenger of Allah , who is the truthful and the believed, told us that: The creation of each one of you is brought together in the womb of his mother in forty days and nights, then he becomes a blood clot for a similar period, and then a morsel of flesh for a similar period. An angel is then sent to him with the command of writing four words: his livelihood, life span, deeds, and whether happy or unhappy; and then blows the breath of life into him. So one of you may behave like the people of Paradise until there is but an arms length between him and Paradise, but what which has been decreed overtakes him and so he starts behaving like the people of Hellfire and thus he enters it. And one of you may behave like people of Hellfire until there is but an arms length between him and it, but what that which has been decreed overtakes him and so he behaves like the people of Paradise and thus he enters it.4 . Based on the above, it is permissible to use anything that does not lead to killing the embryo after its formation - in any stage of its development, no matter how early. Allah the Almighty knows best."

I have a 3 years old child.",
    "Answer": "It is established in Islamic law that if a wife is divorced after consummating the marriage, she is entitled alimony which is paid for two years at least according to the husband's ability. It is also permissible to pay it in installments. The munificent Shari'ah made the estimation of the sum of alimony dependent upon the common practice [of the country] and on the husband's financial capability. God Almighty says:But make fair provision for them, the rich according to his means and the poor according to his—this is a duty for those who do good [Al-Baqarah, 236].Divorced women shall also have such maintenance as is considered fair: this is a duty for those who are mindful of God [Al-Baqarah, 241].-Alimony and conventional lawArticle 18 of statute no. 25 for the year 1929, which was modified by law no. 100 for the year 1985 includes: A divorcée whose valid marriage has been consummated, and whose husband has divorced her without her consent and where she is not its cause, deserves — in addition to her waiting period expenses —alimony equal to at least two years of her typical expenses. The sum takes into consideration the prosperity or poverty of the husband, the circumstances of the divorce, and the duration of the marriage. It may be paid in installments.The sum is estimated by the judge according to what he sees suitable for the case brought before him. -The child's custodyIt is obligatory upon the husband, after divorce, to provide for the child's expenses. This is estimated according to what suffices her needs including, food, drink, residence, education and anything necessary for her life. This should be according to the father's financial ability. The same applies to providing for the mother of the child since the husband is to provide for his divorcee's residence where she stays with her child."

    "Answer": "From the well known principles of Islamic law is the axiom, \"affinity prohibits a husband to marry his step daughters with whose mother he consummated marriage.\" This axiom's application is unrestricted- whether they (the husband and the wife) are married, divorced or the wife is deceased. Allah Almighty said:And (forbidden to you for marriage are) your step-daughters who reside with you, [born] of your wives of whom you have consummated the marriage.[Qur`an 4:23]The prohibition of a girl marrying her stepfather is not contingent on whether she resides with him. Scholars applied the restrictive clause, \"your step-daughters who reside with you,\" from the verse above in the figurative sense. Meaning, that in most cases, a stepdaughter is brought up by her mother under the guardianship of her stepfather, but if this were not the case (if she were raised in her real father's home), the prohibition of marriage still stands.The rulingYour current husband is considered a mahram to your daughter from your first marriage.Allah Almighty knows best."

At the same time, the court will ask the person who would have been responsible to support her had she been unmarried, such as her father or brother, to provide for her, with the husband having to pay back these expenses if he has the means. It is permissible for the wife to ask the court to enforce an order for spousal support, such as by requesting permission from the court to borrow money for her expenses and having the husband pay off the debt. In this case, the creditor is to collect the debt directly from the husband. If the judge refuses to grant her permission, then she is to repay the debt herself and ask her husband for reimbursement.The rulingIf the husband's financial incapacity is established—by any means whatsoever—the judge may rule that the person who would have been responsible to support her had she been unmarried, is to bear her expenses and the husband is to pay him back if he has the means. Alternatively, the court may permit the wife to borrow money for her expenses and assign that debt to her husband. In this case, the creditor may sue the husband for repayment after obtaining the court's permission.The above answers the question and Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "A question about whether the shabka (the present that the groom traditionally buys his wife-to-be, as a token of love and appreciation. It ranges from a simple gold wedding band to a small collection of diamond rings, priceless necklaces and jingly bracelets) is to be returned after filing for khul'a (divorce initiated by the wife in return for remuneration to the husband]).",
    "Answer": "It is established in Islamic law that a wife who files for divorce through khul'a must waive her right to mu`akhar sadaq [deferred dowry]. This is based on a hadith in which it is narrated that the wife of Thabit ibn Qays approached the prophet [pbuh] and said: \" 'O messenger of Allah! I do not find blame with Thabit ibn Qays in anything concerning his character or religion, but I do not want to disobey [the teachings of Islam].' The prophet [pbuh] said, 'Do you agree to return the orchard he gave you as mahr?' 'Yes,' she replied. So the prophet told Thabit, 'O Thabit! Accept the orchard and grant her divorce' \" [Bukhari]. It is deduced from this hadith that, since the orchard was her mahr and the prophet asked her to return it, a woman who files for divorce through khul'a must similarly return the mahr to her husband. The ShabkaAccording to Egyptian customs that do not contradict Islamic law, the mahr includes the shabka. The RulingBased on the above, it is obligatory to return the shabka in the event of divorce through khul'a because it is part of the mahr that must be returned according Egyptian custom. The above answers the question and Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Answer": "The opinion implemented in Egypt by law and fatwa is as follows: Based on the opinion of some scholars on this issue, when the courts grant a woman divorce through khul'a [divorce in return for reimbursement of her bridal wealth] she is to return the bridal wealth she received. Registry of furnishingsThe registry of furnishings is a wife's civil right that is similar to a debt which a husband owes his wife. If there is nothing in the registry of furniture to indicate that all or part of it constitutes the bridal wealth, then it is the wife's exclusive right whether or not she is divorced through khul'a; she does not have to give back the articles included in the registry of furnishings after khul'a.However, a wife must return to her husband any item mentioned in the registry of furnishings which constitutes the bridal wealth, since in this case it is not considered a debt but compensation in return for a divorce.Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling of a woman traveling to attend conferences? This concerns my sister who is a professor in the faculty of medicine who will be traveling without a mahram [a male relative she cannot ever marry]. Keeping in mind that she is over forty-five years old: what is the rule and the necessary conditions for her traveling to avoid committing a sin?",
    "Answer": "The basic rule when a woman travels is that she be accompanied by a mahram. Proof to this is the hadith [narrated through] Ibn ‘Abbas :A woman must not travel unless she is accompanied by a mahram, and no man is to enter into her company unless she is accompanied by a mahram.1However, some Maliki jurists and jurists from other schools allow a woman to travel alone if the way and destination are safe. This is based on the hadith of ‘Adi ibn Hatem that the Prophet said to him:And if you live a long life, you will surely see a woman traveling from Hira till she circumambulates the Ka‘bah – fearing no one except Allah.2Imam Ahmad’s narration incudes:By He in whose hands is my soul: verily Allah will bring this matter [the religion of Islam] into completion till a woman travels from Heera, circumambulates Ka‘bah without being accompanied by anyone.They said that the cause for prohibition in the first hadith is when the path is not safe and there is a lack of security. One can follow this opinion because of its facilitation and vastness. This, however, is limited by her husband’s approval (if she is married), or her guardian’s (if she is not).Based on this and in reference to the question: your sister can travel unaccompanied by a mahram provided that it is safe, and following the opinion of the scholars who permit this.________________________________________1.

I would like to know the manner of giving zakat on this sum and its nisab. Is zakat to be paid on the original sum only or on the original sum as well as on its interest?2- Is it permissible to donate a sum from the money of the deceased as an ongoing charity to benefit his soul without harming his son's interests?",
    "Answer": "1- The nisab (minimum sum upon which zakat is due) for zakat on wealth is the equivalent of 85 grams of 21 carat gold. Zakat is 2.5%of the original sum. The same percentage is due on the interest if it has been possessed for one year.

    "Question": "A few days after a person dies, his family invites scholars and others to his house where they gather to invoke peace and blessings upon the Prophet and make supplications for the sake of the deceased and all Muslims—the living and dead. The family serves food to the attendees out of gratitude for having accepted the invitation and for comforting them. Is there anything prohibited in such a ceremony? Is it permissible for the guests to eat from the food they are served?",
    "Answer": "There is no legal objection to holding such a gathering provided: It does not renew the grief of the deceased's family, in which case it is disliked. The money used in preparing this gathering must not belong to minors, in which case it is prohibited.Scholarly opinionsAlthough a group of latter scholars from the Hanafi School considered it legally disliked to hold such a gathering, the prominent Hanafi, Al-Tahtawi, said that such a gathering is permissible and there is no objection to it, transmitting this position from luminaries of the school. In his meta-commentary on Maraqi Al-Falah Sharh Noor Al-Idah (339-340), he conveyed the following scholarly opinions:Ash-Shurunbulali: \"It is disliked to host guests at the house of the deceased ….\" Al-Bazazi in Fatawa Al-Bazaziya: \"It is disliked to serve food to guests on the first, third and seventh day after the death of the deceased; take food to the graveyard on the different occasions; invite others over to recite the Qur`an; invite righteous people and Qur'an reciters to complete reciting the entire Qur'an or recite Surat Al-An'am or Al-Ikhlas.\" Al-Burhan al-Halabi: \"The opinion [of those scholars who maintain that such gathering is disliked] needs to be reviewed because they based their opinion on the hadith narrated by Jarir Ibn 'Abdullah who said, 'We (the Companions) used to consider it a form of niyaha[1] to assemble at the house of the deceased and eat from the food they have prepared” [Recorded by Imam Ahmed and Ibn Majah with a sound chain of transmission]. This hadith proves that such a gathering is only disliked at the time of death. This opinion was contradicted by the report of 'Asem Ibn Kulaib through his father who narrated it from a man from among the Ansar[2] who said, \"We went out with the Messenger of Allah to attend a funeral. Upon his return, the Prophet was met by a messenger from the wife of the deceased inviting him to the house. Food was served and the Messenger of Allah and the rest of the people ate from it\" [Recorded by Imam Ahmed with a sound chain of transmission and by Abu Dawud]. This hadith proves that it is permissible for the deceased's family to prepare food and invite people to eat from it.From Fatawa Al-Bazaziya in the chapter on Istihsan: \"It is commendable if the family of the deceased prepares food and invites the poor to eat from it.\"From the collection of Fatawa Al-Khaniya in the chapter on Istihsan: \"It is recommended for the family of the deceased to prepare food and invite the poor to eat from it. Nothing is to be deducted from the estate for such a gathering if the heirs include a minor.\" Abu al-Layth As-Samarqandi in Shir'at Al-Islam wa As-Sunnah: \"It is recommended for the family of the deceased to give out in charity, with whatever is possible, before the end of the first night after his death. If they have nothing to give in charity, they are to offer two rak'as (units of prayer) and dedicate their reward to the deceased.\" He also said: \"It is desirable to give out something, whatever is possible, in charity on behalf of the deceased for seven days after his burial.\" The rulingThere is no objection to holding such gatherings and there is no harm in eating from the food served therein.

    "Question": "What is the ruling of religion for permitting abortion and the acknowledging an illegitimate offspring?",
    "Answer": "Islam prohibits all forms of deviant sexual behavior including fornication, adultery and homosexuality, considering them amongst the grave sins. Protecting the rights of offspring is among the reasons for legislating marriage and, for this reason, Islam commands everything that leads to it and prohibits anything that distracts from it. It commands chastity and virtue and prohibits immorality, wrongdoing and tyranny. Furthermore, Islam prohibits men from imitating women and vice versa. It attributed to each gender the characteristics and functions that suit their constitution and tied all this to judgment on the Day of Judgment, administering the earth and purifying the self. Muslims therefore firmly believe that violating these [Divine injunctions] destroys society and portends evil consequences both in this world and in the Hereafter; it is considered a great corruption upon the earth that must be resisted and its perpetrators advised against and shown its evil ramifications.AbortionIslam prohibits any assault against Allah's creation; it therefore prohibits abortion unless there is a medical necessity to preserve a woman's health. Moreover, Islam seeks to preserve lineage which is an objective of Islamic law, it does not acknowledge any sexual relationship between the sexes outside of a legal marriage, and deems paternity as based on a legal affiliation rather than a natural one.Adultery and paternityIslamic law does not recognize the paternity of a fornicator and deems the semen ejaculated during fornication as forfeit. 'A`isha narrated that the Prophet [pbuh] said, \"The child belongs to the man on whose bed it is born and the fornicator is to be stoned\" [Muslim and Bukhari]. Moreover, the tables are turned against the fornicator as he cannot attribute to himself a child he conceived from an illicit relationship. Rather, the child is attributed to its mother because maternity is a natural relationship unlike paternity which cannot be established except by a lawful marriage. Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to substitute the last component of my ward's full name with the fourth component of my full name?",
    "Answer": "It is permissible In Islamic law for the guardian of an orphan, man or woman, to add his/her family name to that of his ward who is an orphan or a child of unknown parentage. It is likewise permissible to change the last component of the child's full name to that of his guardian in a manner that shows the ward's affiliation to his guardian without deceiving the child or others that he is the guardian's biological offspring. The purpose is to remove the affiliation from the scope of adoption which is prohibited in Islamic law. Such an addition to the child's full name is tantamount to the bonds of loyalty between the Arabian tribes of old. This is permissible in Islamic law and achieves the child's interests in the different phases of his life though the principles of Islamic law concerning. adoption and its legal consequences must be preserved.The rulingIt is permissible to substitute the last component of the ward's full name with the fourth component of his guardian's name.

    "Question": "What is the legal ruling for establishing a child's paternity?",
    "Answer": "Although genetic fingerprinting is used to determine filial relationship, it is established in Islamic law that the rules of maternity are based on the biological affiliation between a child and its mother, while paternity is determined by law. This means that any child born out of wedlock is not attributed to the fornicator though it is biologically attributed to its mother since she bore and gave birth to it. Accordingly, all the rules of maternity are established between the child and its mother such as those concerning inheritance, prohibition of marriage and so forth. A child's paternity is not established except within the confines of a valid marriage, an invalid marriage [in which one of the integrals or conditions of marriage is missing] or a mistaken intercourse which the person thinks is licit (an example of this is a mistaken belief of one's marital status). There is a scholarly consensus that paternity is not established in the absence of any of the above, this being the stance of Egyptian law. The rulingIn a paternity case, a judge must spare no effort to establish the paternity of a child. If it is made clear or proved to the court that a child was born into a valid marriage, paternity must be granted. In the absence of evidence proving a valid or an invalid marriage or mistaken intercourse, the court must not attribute the child to the man in question even if genetic fingerprinting proves he is the biological father. This is because paternity, as mentioned above, is based upon a legal relationship and not a biological one. Allah Almighty knows best."

Allah will not bless those who revive these practices. Moreover, it is considered wrongfully consuming another's property which is among the major sins for which Allah threatened with a grave punishment.

It is irrelevant whether they died in the same accident or not.Scholars have expressed this as the inheritance of those who die from drowning, in a fire or under a collapsed building.

A tenant merely owns the utility (rental contract) and not the property itself which belongs to the proprietor.

    "Answer": "A mother is entitled to custody i.e. guardianship over the rearing and bringing up of the child due to his need for her in taking care of him and seeing to his needs.It is natural for a child to be raised by both parents for his welfare, care and support. In the event of separation and unless she lacks any of the required conditions, a mother takes precedence over the father with regards to her child's custody. A custodial mother rears and brings up her child in return for expenses paid by the father as stated in Article 388 of Law no. 21/1929 of the Personal Status law.On the other hand, a father has full guardianship over his minor child and enjoys authority concerning his or her schooling and education. He assumes any other responsibility even if the child is less than 10 years i.e. is in his mother's custody. This is because a mother's guardianship revolves around only taking care of the child.

He promised to convert to Islam and marry me but he never did. He pays alimony for our daughter but my fear is that he might at some point file a law suit claiming his right for custody. I would be devastated for that to happen.",
    "Answer": "It is legally impermissible in Islamic law to give the adopted child the full name of the foster family which would be reflected in the legal rights that the adopted child will share with the adoptive family. God says in the Quran “Call them by [the names of] their fathers; it is more just in the sight of Allah . But if you do not know their fathers - then they are [still] your brothers in religion and those entrusted to you.” 33:5It is also well known that the noble companion Zayd ibn Haritha was previously known as Zayd ibn Muhammad as he was adopted by Prophet Muhammad who treated him like his own child and attributed his name to him. After God prohibited attributing the name of the foster father to the adopted child, the Prophet returned Zayd’s name back to his biological father and was known for it.It is legally permissible to give the adopted child only the family name of his foster family which guarantees loyalty of the adopted child to his new home without claiming biological ties with the adopted child which is prohibited in Islamic law.Adding the family name of the foster family would be more like the attachment of loyalty which was popular among the Arab tribes. There is no legal impediments to such act as the prohibited adoption would be to fully give the child the name of the foster father as if the child is his own which has legal repercussions in terms of inheritance, lineage, rules of modesty with foster sisters..etc.As for the verse in which God says “Call them by [the names of] their fathers; it is more just in the sight of Allah . But if you do not know their fathers - then they are [still] your brothers in religion and those entrusted to you.” 33:5, Ibn Kathir in his Quranic exegesis stated that calling the adopted child “son” out of love and kindness is not prohibited and he used the prophetic tradition which was reported by Muslim in which the Prophet called his servant “Anas” as “son”.Therefore the mere fact of attaching the family name of the foster family to the adopted child, which does not have any legal repercussions, is not prohibited in Islam. In Islam attributing the family name to a person who does not belong to the family biologically can be done for a number of reasons:- Emancipation: when a slave is freed, he usually takes the family name of his emancipator such as Abu al Bukhturi al Tai who got his last name from the tribe of his emancipator.- Pledge of allegiance: this pledge is usually formed among tribes for mutual support and defense against attacks. So it is common for the people of the two allied tribes to take the name of the allied tribe as their last name.- Pledge of companionship due to business or knowledge: it was common if a man stayed long enough in the company of another for the sake of learning and gaining knowledge or if they had commercial dealings to take his family name.- Pledge of religion: if a man was guided to Islam through another man, it is permissible to take the latter’s family name.Ibn al Salah, the renowned scholar, stated that the attribution of a man to a tribe which is not his own was common. For example there were people who did not take their father’s name but actually took their mother’s name such as Sharhabeel ibn Hasanah and others took their grand mother’s name such as Ya’li ibn Muniah and others took their grand father’s name such as Abu ‘Ubaydah ibn al Jarrah and others were attributed to men who were not their fathers such as al Miqdad ibn al Aswad who was raised in the house of Al Aswad ibn ‘Abd Yaghuth.So these are examples which prove that it was common for a man to take other people’s names as long as it does not entail legal repercussions which deem such act impermissible. Same goes for the adopted child when he takes the family name of his adoptive family. Taking the family name especially for a child with an unknown lineage is crucially important for his psychological wellbeing and his healthy upbringing.Therefore, in your case the illegal relationship which you had with the first man is considered adultery and lineage is not proven through adultery. In other words your daughter is not legally considered to be his legal daughter and therefore it is permissible to give your daughter the family name of your husband but not his first and second name."

    "Answer": "Regulation of child custody Custody regulations serve to protect the child, his welfare and interests. With this in mind, custody of a child may be transferred from one custodian to the next natural guardian as sanctioned by Islamic law. Guardianship for raising a childIslamic law prescribes custody as a means of protecting the child, including protecting his physical, moral and religious interests. Moreover, it provides the custodian with the opportunity to practice selflessness and generosity. Child custody lawThe objective of child custody law, derived from the Islamic Law revolves around the sole interests of the child. Article no. 20 of decree law no.25/1929 as amended by law no. 100/1985 states: \"Each of the parents has the right to see the child. Grandparents have the same right in the absence of the charge's parents.\" 'In the absence of the charge's parents' means if they do not reside in the same city as the child or are deceased. This right was granted to grandparents because they are granted the status of parents in Islamic Law (if the parents are absent or unable to fulfill the child's rights).A mother's custody of her child does not prevent the child's paternal relatives from taking care of him, housing and teaching him while he is in her custody. Since the grandfather is among the paternal relatives, he is explicitly entitled to visit the child of his absent son.The Maliki scholar, Al-Dusuki, stated in his commentary on Al-Sharh al-Kabir by Sidi Ahmed al-Dardir: \"The father and other relatives are entitled to see to the child's education and upbringing while he is in his mother's custody\"; taking care of the child necessarily involves visiting him.

Is the husband entitled to take the money he spent on the construction of the two apartments in addition to his rightful share in the inheritance?",

Her ownership is established because the apartments were located on her land and she died while they were still on her property. This fact cannot be changed except by stronger [evidence to the contrary].Merely paying for the cost of construction involves unlimited possibilities which may include:- The cost of construction was in return for a debt the husband owed his wife.- It constituted her dowry or its deferred portion.- It is a gift the husband made to his wife which she accepted and received while she was alive.In addition to the above, there may be other rational possibilities. It is possible that the two apartments do in fact belong to the husband.

[Al-Baqarah, 236]Divorced women shall also have such maintenance as is considered fair: this is a duty for those who are mindful of God. [Al-Baqarah, 241]Alimony and conventional lawArticle 18 of statute no. 25 for the year 1929, which was modified by law no. 100 for the year 1985 includes:A divorcée whose valid marriage has been consummated, and whose husband has divorced her without her consent and where she is not its cause, deserves — in addition to her waiting period expenses —alimony equal to at least two years expenses. The sum takes into consideration the prosperity or poverty of the husband, the circumstances of the divorce, and the duration of the marriage. It may be paid in installments.The sum is estimated by the judge according to what he sees suitable for the case before him.Waiting period expensesThese are the obligatory expenses owed to the divorcée during her waiting period; they include all kinds of expenses that a wife is entitled to during her marriage. The judge's decision is based upon the wife's assertion on the duration of her waiting period provided it does not exceed one year from the date of divorce. This is the procedure followed by Egyptian law based on the preponderant opinion of scholars. The sum is determined by the judge according to what he sees suitable to the case before him.If the couple decides to settle out of court, then they are to agree upon the sums of both alimony and the waiting period expenses. The prevailing practice in regard to alimony is that the husband pays a quarter of his salary for two years. The duration of the waiting period expenses ranges between three months to one year depending upon the occurrence of the woman's menstrual cycle and on the husband's financial status as mentioned earlier."

    "Question": "My sister has a sister-through-nursing, so is it permissible for me to marry this sister through-nursing?",
    "Answer": "It is legally established that the sister of a sister-through-nursing is not considered a sister-through-nursing. So, if your sister had been breast-fed by the mother of that girl, your sister is a sister of that girl through nursing, but this relation through nursing does not extend to you, so you are not her brother-through-nursing and you, thus, are permitted to marry her. However, if you meant that this girl and your sister had been breast-fed by your mother, then she will be your sister-through-nursing and it is not permissible for you to marry her. This applies when breast-feeding was during the first two years and they were five full feedings. And Allah knows best."

    "Question": "Is it permissible for a menstruating woman to remain in the mosque to listen to religious lectures? Please take into account that the place where the lessons for women are held is annexed to the mosque. And is it permissible for a menstruating woman to enter the mosque to deliver religious lessons to other women?",
    "Answer": "It is impermissible for a woman in a state of menstruation to enter the women's section of the mosque even if it is to attend lessons or memorize the Qur`an except if she is passing through due to the words of God Who says,O ye who believe! Approach not prayers in a state of intoxication, until ye can understand all that ye say,--nor in a state of ceremonial impurity except when you are passing by (through the mosque). [Al-Nisa`, 43]A woman in a state of menstruation is in a more extreme state than a person in a state of major ritual impurity. This is because the latter can lift the state of major ritual impurity by bathing but a menstruating woman remains in a state of impurity until her period ends. It has been reported that the Prophet said, \"I do not permit a woman in her menses or a person in a state of major ritual impurity to enter the mosque\" [recorded by Abu Dawud, al-Baihaqi, and by al-Bukhari in Al-Tareekh Al-Kabeer]. Though the hadith is classified as weak, the majority of scholars put it into practice, it is cited in the fatawa of the early jurists, and is the opinion of the scholars of the four schools of jurisprudence.Maliki scholars maintained the impermissibility of a menstruating woman entering the mosque even if she is merely passing through. This opinion is stated in Bidayat Al-Mujtahid by the Maliki scholars Ibn Rushd who said, \"… Some scholars permit this i.e. a menstruating woman entering the mosque — whether she is passing through or stays inside it; these include Dawud al-Zahiri and his disciples.\"From the above, it is clear that the scholars who permit a woman in a state of menstruation to enter the mosque are the Zahirite scholars whose opinion is disregarded in favor of the opinion of the majority of scholars who include the scholars of the four schools of jurisprudence.The rulingA menstruating woman may deliver or attend religious lessons if the place where the lessons are held is annexed to the mosque and not a part of it; it does not take the same ruling as a mosque.God the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "My sister wants to marry the son of my paternal uncle. My brother was nursed with him, and we do not know how many nursings occurred: whether it was a more or less than five. Is it permissible for her to marry him?",
    "Answer": "If you mean that your brother and the son of your paternal uncle had been breast-fed by your paternal uncle’s wife or any woman other than your mother, then it is permissible for your sister to marry the son of your paternal uncle regardless of the number of nursings. This is because the sister of a brother-through-nursing is not considered a sister-through-nursing. However, if you mean that the son of your paternal uncle and your brother had been breast-fed by your mother, then it is unlawful for the son of your paternal uncle to marry your sister if five satiating nursings have occurred within the first two years of the child’s life. This is because he would then be your sister’s brother-through-nursing. According tot he Shafi‘is and Hanbalis, if it is not know whether five nursings had occurred or not, it is then permissible to execute that marriage, because they maintain that the prohibition is not established until five satisfying nursings occur, and as long as there is doubt whether five nursings have taken place [it remains lawful] since what is certain (i.e. marriage) is not negated by doubt [i.e. occurrence of five nursings]. This is the opinion issued for fatwa because the matter so commonly occurs. Allah Most High knows best."

    "Question": "A married man committed adultery with a married woman in a country that does not implement the [Islamic] prescribed legal punishment for this crime. How is he to repent? To do so, must the prescribed punishment be inflicted upon him?",
    "Answer": "Abu Hurayra, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"I heard the prophet [pbuh] say, \"All members of my community are pardoned except for those who announce their sins. Among those who announce their sins is someone who commits a crime by night; Allah has concealed it, yet when morning comes he says: \"O, so-and-so! Yesterday I did such-and-such.\" He spent the night with his sins covered by his Lord, and when he wakes up he exposes what Allah has concealed\" [Bukhari and Muslim].A person who commits a sin must refrain from divulging it when Allah has concealed it from others; one of the attributes of Allah Almighty is concealing human faults and failings. A person who announces his sins when Allah has concealed them attaches little importance to His protection and is ungrateful to His grace and mercy. Repentance is by doing the following:- desisting from one's sin;- regretting having done it;- resolving never to commit it again;- asking for Allah's forgiveness in abundance. Allah almighty does not require that a person who has committed a sin for which there is a prescribed legal punishment to strive to have the punishment inflicted upon him. Rather, he is commanded to conceal his mistake; the ruler is the one to exact punishments as it is one of his duties. It has been reported that a man, Ma'iz ibn Malik, fornicated with a slave girl who was not permissible for him. Huzal ordered him to go to the prophet [pbuh] before whom Ma'iz testified against himself four times. After ordering that he be stoned to death, the prophet [pbuh] turned to Huzal and said: \"It would have been better if you had covered him with your cloak\" [Abu Dawud and al-Nisa`i]."

    "Question": "My husband and I agreed amicably not to have children and to conduct an abortion if I happen to get pregnant. This is because he has another wife and supports three children. I agreed to his request due to his great insistence. Allah willed that I become pregnant, and now, my husband wants me to choose between having an abortion and a divorce. He also accuses me of betrayal and deceit. Is it permissible for me to conduct an abortion on account of our agreement even though I am yearning to have children? Is it permissible for me to honor our agreement and conduct an abortion even though I am yearning to have children?",
    "Answer": "The agreement in question is divided into two parts: the first is the couple's agreement not to have children and the second is their decision to terminate the pregnancy if the wife becomes pregnant. The first part of the agreement is permissible since the ruling for 'azl (coitus interruptus) revolves around being lawful or disliked; there is a scholarly controversy on the matter (the various means of birth control take the same ruling as 'azl) . According to either ruling, there is no sin in using it and therefore, it is permissible to agree on it. Jabir said, \"We practiced 'azl during the Prophet's lifetime; he was informed about it and did not forbid us [from practicing it]\" [Muslim].If it is permissible to enter into an agreement, then breaking it is considered a violation. Consequently, if the wife deliberately became pregnant, then she has broken a permissible promise and this is a sin. Otherwise, she is not blameworthy.The second part of the agreement is impermissible because it is unlawful to terminate a pregnancy except if:1. A trustworthy Muslim physician determines that the pregnancy poses danger to the woman.2. The abortion is before 120 days of pregnancy.3. The abortion does not result in harm that is equivalent to or greater than that caused by the pregnancy.In the absence of the above, abortion is unlawful and both spouses err by entering into a sinful agreement. It is impermissible for the inquirer to obey her husband and terminate the pregnancy since there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobeying Allah. 'Ali narrated that the Prophet said, \"Obedience is required in good deeds.\" The wife does not sin by not fulfilling this part of the agreement; rather, she is blameworthy if she does, as is her husband for commanding her to do so.The rulingIf the wife deliberately became pregnant, then she has committed a sin by breaking her promise. Abu Huraira narrated a raised chain hadith in which the Messenger of Allahsaid, \"The traits of a hypocrite are three: When he speaks, he lies; when he promises, he reneges; when he is entrusted, he betrays his trust\" [Bukhari and Muslim].The wife does not sin if she did not become pregnant deliberately. In the above scenario, the spouses agreed on something unlawful which is to abort a pregnancy when it occurs. It is not permissible for the husband to order his wife to do so as it is likewise impermissible for her to obey him in this [even] if he insists. The couple should know that a pregnancy is a blessing from Allah Who He the [child's] protector and guardian because He is the Lord of the worlds. Furthermore, this child may have the goodness, morals, religion and blessings that the husband's other children may lack. Allah Almighty says,If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and Allah brings about through it a great deal of good.[An-Nisaa`:19] Each person must know his place and not fight the will of Allah because He is never overpowered. Our destiny is predetermined, so we must accept it; this is better for us both in this world and in the Hereafter.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Some married couples like to do some sexual fantasies so they role play the master and the slave and this sex act could contain some sadism so one party can get hurt. So is this sexual fantasy prohibited or not?",
    "Answer": "Sadism indicates the tendency to derive pleasure and sexual gratification from inflicting pain, suffering or humiliation on others. This terminology was first used by the French writer Marquis De Sade (1740- 1814) who was known for his erotic and controversial literature which included a lot of violent sexual content.It is well known that hurting the other party whether psychologically or physically in the sexual relationship or in any other relationship is legally prohibited. God says, “Say, My Lord has only forbidden immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed - and sin, and oppression without right, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down authority, and that you say about Allah that which you do not know.\" 7:33The Prophet also said, “Do not inflict harm” and preserving one’s life is one of the major objectives of the Isalmic Shari’ah. The renowned Muslim scholars believe that the Islamic Shari’ah with all its variant rulings revolve around preserving the five major objectives of Shari’ah which are preserving life, religion, dignity, mind and possession. It was narrated through ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet said during the last sermon in pilgrimage, “O people your blood, money, and honors are forbidden” (Bukhari).As for engaging in sexual acts in any position that the couple agree on is lawful as God says, “Your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you, so come to your place of cultivation however you wish and put forth [righteousness] for yourselves” 2:223All sexual positions are permissible except for anal sex and also engaging in sex during the wife’s menstrual period is deemed impermissible. God says, “And they ask you about menstruation. Say, \"It is harm, so keep away from wives during menstruation. And do not approach them until they are pure.” 2:222Therefore all sexual acts are permissible except also for acts that are forced by one party on the other which might lead to repulsion and repugnance."

    "Question": "My daughter, who is an engineer, got married over a year ago. Since then her husband has prevented her from visiting both her immediate and extended families and her friends and even isolated her from the outside world to the extent that he prevents her from answering our calls. In the few instances when we communicated with her, he would be at the other end of the line, overhearing our conversations or even recording them as he maintains. He refuses to allow anyone from her family to visit or even phone her.- Is it permissible for him to drive our daughter to being undutiful to us and severing ties of kinship?- Is it permissible for her to obey him in this regard?",
    "Answer": "The duty of maintaining ties of kinship is established in Islamic law. Allah the Almighty says, And to parents do good and to relatives. [Al-Baqarah, 83] Abu Hurairah narrated that a man approached the Prophet and asked, \"Who is the most deserving of my companionship?\"The Prophet replied, \"Your mother.\" The man then asked, \"Then who?\" The Prophet replied, \"Your mother.\" The man asked again, \"Then who?\" The Prophet again replied, \"Your mother.\" Once again the man asked, \"Then who?\" The Prophet replied, \"Your father\" [Reported by Bukhari, Muslim and others].Based on their chosen opinion mentioned in Al-Ikhtiyar, Hanafi scholars determined that a husband may not prevent his wife from visiting her parents once a week if they cannot visit her themselves. Furthermore, he is not to prevent them from visiting her once a week. This same opinion was mentioned in At-Tanwir and the commentary written on it. Based on this, a woman may visit her parents once a week with or without her husband's permission. The same ruling applies to visiting her grandfather if her father is absent or her grandmother if her mother is absent. However, it is impermissible for her to spend the night away from her house without her husband's permission. This is the opinion implemented by law as stated in Article 280 of the Shari'ah courts. In the absence of any text, the preponderant opinion of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence is implemented. This does not contravene a husband's guardianship. It is impermissible for a man to prevent his wife from fulfilling her obligations to others. Just as it impermissible for him to prevent her from praying, fasting, paying zakat, performing Hajj and the rest of the obligations prescribed by Islamic law, it is likewise impermissible for him to prevent her from maintaining ties with her parents and relatives. It is not permissible for him, under the pretext of matrimonial obedience, to isolate her from the outside world as if she were a prisoner. Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet said, \"Treat women kindly\" [Reported by Bukhari, Muslim and others]. The Prophet also said, \"The best of you are those who are best to their wives\" [Reported by Al-Tirmidhi].A woman is not to obey her husband if he orders her, directly or indirectly, to sever ties of kinship and be undutiful to her parents since obedience should only be in good acts. The husband, wife and in-laws must all be mindful of Allah Who says, If they both desire reconciliation, Allah will cause it between them. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Acquainted [with all things]. [Al-Nisa`, 4:35]Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Background",
    "Answer": "Who are the Qadianiyya? Qadianiyya is a [religious] sect named after Qadian, one of the villages in the Punjab area, India. It was founded by Ghulam Ahmad al-Qadyani.Birth and LineageGhulam Ahmad was born in 1839 CE in the village of Qadian and died on 26 May 1908 in the city of Lahore. He is buried in Qadian. It was said that his parents came from Samarqand; his lineage can be traced back to Mogul or Persian descent.He was born into a family loyal to their British colonialists; his father, Ghulam Murtada, forged close relations with the British government and occupied a position in the imperialist British government in India. In 1851, his father helped the British government against his country and fellow Muslims providing the colonialists with soldiers and horses.Intellectual background and movement Ghulam Ahmad read extensively both in Urdu and Arabic. He occupied a job in Sialcot.In 1877, Ghulam Ahmad embarked on his evil mission and published his book, Baraheen Ahmadiyya, in several volumes.In 1885 he claimed that he was the mujaddid [En. divine reformer] and in 1891 claimed to be the Anticipated Mahdi and the Promised Messiah: \"I am the Messiah, I am word of God and I am both Muhammad and Ahmad\", claiming to be the best of all Prophets.Ghulam Ahmad was cunning; he did not explicitly antagonize Islam but adopted the guise of reformation and development. He delivered his message in stages—first claiming to be the Anticipated Mahdi, then he claimed to have received Divine revelations, not as a law-bearing prophet, but as a deputy prophet like Haroun was to Musa. He distorted the meanings of the noble Qur'an to fulfill his ambitions.His son and successor, Mahmud, continued propagating his father's [fraudulent] claims and course of disbelief. He said, \"We consider anyone who does not believe in Qadianiyya a disbeliever because the Qur'an says whoever denies any of the Messengers, is a disbeliever. Based on this, whoever denies that Ghulam Ahmad is a prophet and messenger is a disbeliever?\"His second son complicated matters even more by saying, \"Whoever believes in Musa but not in 'Isa, or believes in 'Isa but not in Muhammad is a disbeliever. The same is true for those who do not believe in Ghulam Ahmad, they are disbelievers.\"Qadiani books claim that Allah sent a revelation to Ghulam Ahmad saying, \"Whoever loves Me [i.e. Allah], must follow and believe in you [i.e. Ghulam Ahmad]; otherwise, he will be My enemy. We will reward those who deny and harm you with a grievous penalty—the abode of Hellfire.\"Tenets and Beliefs- The Qadyaniyya sect denies that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is the seal of prophets: \"We believe that Allah continues to send Messengers to reform this community and guide it whenever necessary.\" This claim is a declaration of disbelief in itself. It contradicts the words of Allah Almighty: Muhammad is not the father of [any] one of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and last of the prophets. And ever is Allah , of all things, Knowing [Al-Ahzab, 40].Moreover, it contradicts the words of the prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, who said; \"There is no prophet after me\" [Bukhari]."

    "Question": "I am a Sunni girl and had a marriage proposal from a Shi’te man of the Ja’fariyyah madhab. He seems right for me but I am scared of having differences when it comes to educating our kids about what to believe. Please help me.",
    "Answer": "My perspective on the Shi’te revolves around the need to acknowledge the Shiites as a progressive sect with which we can cooperate at present even if we differ on certain issues. This is because a Muslim is concerned with searching for wisdom and implementing it even if it were issued by someone with whom he differs on some issues.The difference between the two sects is not of the nature that should result in disunity in light of the critical circumstances Muslims are experiencing at present. This is especially so since many of the Shiite scholars do not adopt matters in the Shi'a heritage upon which Sunnis do not agree; rather, numerous Shiite scholars renounced many of these views. Therefore, it is not right to judge a person based on what is expressed in some of the books of his sect if he does not adopt the opinions therein himself.There is no objection if a Shiite worships God according to the teachings of his sect; the Shi'a jurisprudence is progressive because the Shiites are by definition a progressive sect since they believe reality to be part and parcel of their fiqh. However, there are those who dig in old Shi'a books and emerge with differences between the Shiites and Sunnis; this is a huge mistake and an injustice to those who do not uphold the views expressed in these books. The Grand Mufti affirmed that any attempts to destroy Sunni-Shiite relations only serve goals which seek to shatter Muslim unity and weaken their strength.It is permissible for a Shiite to worship God according to his fiqh which does not contravene the opinion of the majority and there is no objection to it. The late Grand Sheikh of al-Azhar, Sheikh Mahmud Shaltut, issued a religious verdict stating that the Shi'a is one of the sects of the Islamic community with its own accepted fiqh and is among those acknowledged by al-Azhar.The Islamic community is one whole; there is no difference between Sunnis and Shiites as long as both sects turn to the same direction in prayer. As for the issue of slandering the Companions of the prophet and the rightfully guided Caliphs, especially Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Aisha, the mother of believers, the issue as a whole is foreign to the Shiite methodology; they are old and extrinsic matters that have no existence whatsoever in the acknowledged books of Shi'a. He added that the claim that the Qur`an has been altered is erroneous and has been repudiated by the Shiite imams.He continued to say that the Shiite position on the infallibility of the Twelve Imams is the same as that held by Sunnis regarding the pious friends of God—that God protects them from erring and going astray—they do not mean the infallibility accorded to the prophets. Moreover, unlike the Jews who observe the concept of Bada` (the claim that God is ignorant of future events and only knows of them after they occur), the Shiites maintain the concept of Bada` which corresponds to the Sunni concept of al-Qada` al-Mu'alaq (conditional destiny that could be changed by supplicating God) and abrogation.It is important to note that there is a difference between colligating the two methodologies and between following them. We call to unity by colligating the two methodologies and rectifying their worship according to the endeavors of their followers. But we do not, in anyway, call upon Sunnis to follow the Shi'a methodology, There is a world of difference between the two.The difference between Sunnis and Shi'ites is limited to a few issues, the most important of which is that of the imamate [leadership]. Sunnis believe that the issue of the Muslims' leader [imam] is from among the ancillary branches of religion and that Muslims choose their leader through election and consultancy. They also believe that, unlike Prophets, the leader is fallible. On the other hand, Shi'ites believe that the issue of imamate is from among the fundamentals of religion and that the imam is not chosen by the majority, his imamate is explicitly stated in legal texts [Qur`an], and he is infallible.The Shi'a sect is divided into many extremist and moderate groups. The Twelver (Ithna 'Ashriya) and Zaydiya groups are an essential part of the Muslim community [umma] and the difference between them and between the Sunnis is of no significance. The madhabs [schools of jurisprudence] followed by these two groups are not only taught in the noble Azhar but are sometimes resorted to in issuing fatwas (religious edicts).Based on this, it is permissible for this Shi'ite man to marry this Sunni girl if he is from among the moderate Shi'a groups referred to above. This is because both of them share the same beliefs even if they differ over some subsidiary issues and rulings upon which there are differences of scholarly opinions."

    "Question": "I married a 37 year old Emirati woman who was previously married. The marriage contract was conducted at the lawyer's office in the presence of witnesses. It included the payment of a dowry and met the rest of the conditions. The bride's wali did not consent to the marriage because of my different nationality. After we concluded the marriage contract, I filed a signature verification lawsuit and the court issued its decision [in my favor]. I then notarized the court verdict at the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the UAE embassy. Afterwards, I publicized the marriage to everyone even to my wife's family. However, her father resorted to the courts in the United Arab Emirates claiming the illegitimacy of the marriage because the contract did not fulfill the condition of the presence of the bride's wali. Is the marriage lawful? What is the stance of Islamic law on this?",
    "Answer": "Wilaya (guardianship) in marriage is a kind of protection instituted by Islamic law to secure the interest of a woman's rights at a time when she is starting an important phase in her life. Islamic law established the principles of guardianship on the basis of compassion, support, and assistance to women. Imam Abu Hanifa maintained that it is not obligatory for a sane, adult woman to have a guardian. Based on this, she is entitled to conduct her own marriage contract whether she was previously married or a virgin and restricted the wilaya exclusively to prepubescent females. On the other hand, he maintained that it is a deputation, not guardianship, for the sane, adult female.Egyptian law follows the Hanafi opinion that entitles an adult female to conduct her marriage which is considered valid if it is based on kafa`a (marrying a suitable match) and if she receives mahr al-mithl (the amount typically received as marriage payments by similar brides).Islamic law considers puberty a sign of the beginning of intellectual maturity. Moreover, it considers puberty contingent upon reaching a certain age in the absence of other indicators of puberty.Scholarly opinions on determining the age of pubertyShaif'i and Hanbali scholarsShafi'i and Hanbali scholars and Abu Yusuf and Mohammed maintained that the age of puberty is 15 lunar years for both males and females.Maliki scholarsMaliki scholars maintained that puberty is reached at the age of 18; there are other opinions in the Maliki school determining the age of puberty at the age of 15, 19 and 17.Abu HanifaAbu Hanifa determined the age of puberty at 18 for males and 17 for females.Egyptian LawEgyptian law has organized litigation procedures in personal affairs cases through issuing the law no. 56/1923. The court is to reject cases where the wife's age is less than 16 and the husband's age is less than 18 at the time of conducting the marriage except with the wali's permission. It later enacted Decree law no. 78/1931 in correspondence to the preceding law. Article no. 5\\99 of this law was amended in law no. 88/1951 which determined the age of puberty according to the Hijri calendar. Finally, law no. 1/2000 determined the age of puberty according to the Gregorian Calendar.The rulingThe marriage [mentioned in the question] is valid if it is established on kafa`a and the wife has received mahr al-mithl.The above answers the question and God the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "In East Turkistan, wedding ceremonies are held at the bride's house. It is also the custom for the bride's guardian to take her dowry to buy her marriage needs such as gold and clothes and spend the rest on the wedding ceremony. Is this permissible? Does holding the wedding ceremony in the bride's house contradict Islamic law or is it an innovation?",
    "Answer": "It is permissible to hold the wedding ceremony at the bride's house due to the presumption of permissibility of all things unless there is a clear text to the contrary. This does not contradict Islamic law in any way nor is it an innovation [bid'a]. Those who maintain that it is an innovation are excessively strict and are those who introduce unprecedented matters into religion. The bride's dowry is her property and no one from among her family or others are entitled to any of it except with her consent. Allah Almighty says: And give the women [upon marriage] their [bridal] gifts graciously [Qur`an 4: 4].And it is not lawful for you to take anything of what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep [within] the limits of Allah [Qur`an 2: 229]. In the Qur`anic verse, Allah ascribed the dowry to the bride and not to anyone else, relatives or otherwise. As for the guardian, he is entrusted with his charge's interests; therefore there is no objection to spending the bride's dowry or part of it on the above mentioned expenditures with her consent.

    "Question": "Does marital rape exist in Islam? Is the husband allowed to force his wife to sleep with him? What does Qawamah mean in Islam? What is the legal stance on those who advocate for total equality between husband and wife in obedience and expenditure etc…?",
    "Answer": "Islamic scholars describe that marital rape occurs when the man asks his wife to have sexual intercourse during her menstrual period or in an abnormal sexual position or during fasting hours in Ramadan. God gave the woman the right to refrain from her husband as God says, “And they ask you about menstruation. Say, \"It is harm, so keep away from wives during menstruation. And do not approach them until they are pure. And when they have purified themselves, then come to them from where Allah has ordained for you. Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves.\" 2:222If the husband used violence to force his wife to sleep with him, he is legally a sinner and she has the right to go to court and file a complaint against him to get punished. The woman also has the right to refuse to engage in sexual relationship with her husband if he has a contagious disease or use violence which hurts her body during the sexual intercourse.The Islamic Shari’ah advised that the sexual intercourse between man and wife should be conducted with intimacy and love and made such amicable conduct as a sign of piety. God says in the Quran, “Your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you, so come to your place of cultivation however you wish and make an introduction for yourselves. And fear Allah and know that you will meet Him. And give good tidings to the believers. 2:223The introduction was explained by the Prophet (peace be upon him) when he said, “Three things fall under unkindness and one of them is when the man engages in sexual act with his wife without sending a messenger: humor and kisses. No one should directly fall on his wife like one buffalo does to another”. This hadith was narrated by Anas ibn Malik and though its chain of narration is weak, it can be used as reference points in virtues and ethics.If the wife hated her husband, the Islamic Shari’ah advises her not to be hasty in deciding to leave her husband and encourages her instead to have some patience in order not to destroy the family. God says in the Quran, “For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.” 4:19But if the wife couldn’t bear to live with her husband anymore, the Islamic Shari’ah advises her to seek separation from her husband to avoid animosity, fighting and discord which lead to harm. In this case seeking divorce would be committing the lesser of two damages.As for the definition of Qawamah which God mentioned in the Quran when He says, “Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth…”4:34 This means for the man to take responsibility of his wife and to cater for her needs. For this reason the man is the one who pays dowry, alimony and the wife inherits her allotted share of his wealth after his death. Therefore cancelling the idea of Qawamah is actually a sort of discrimination against women.As for the idea of total equality between husband and wife in Islam, as a matter of fact Islam advocated for equity but not equality. Equity shows when God says in the Quran, “And their Lord responded to them, \"Never will I allow to be lost the work of [any] worker among you, whether male or female; you are of one another….” 3:195 and also says, “Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward [in the Hereafter] according to the best of what they used to do.” 16:97Also Prophet Muhammad says, “Women are the sisters of men” (Abu Dawud and al Tirmidhi). The Islamic Shari’ah did not approve of absolute equality between men and women because of the differences in the specificities and roles for both sexes. God says, \"And the male is not like the female…” 3:36 and also says,”And do not wish for that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of his bounty. Indeed Allah is ever, of all things, Knowing.” 4:32God also says, “And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility]. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.” 2:228 This degree which the verse mentions is the degree of Qawamah or the responsibility which God placed on the shoulder of men and this degree has to do with the specificities and special roles that are designated for men. In other words each gender has it own natural specificities and social roles and this means that the relationship between them is not one of competition but of complementarity. God says, “O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted”. 49:13As for the call of absolute equality in terms of expenditure, leadership, and the cancellation of the wife’s obedience to her husband is a matter which leads to societal chaos and a disruption in the natural roles of both genders."

    "Question": "The Islamic law bestows the right of guardianship to some individuals to protect the charges' interests and ward off harm. This right allows guardians to exercise their will over their charges. The Islamic law considers mental incapacity and legal incompetence two reasons for establishing guardianship; the existence of one of them constitutes sufficient grounds for establishing guardianship over another person.Types of guardian ships according to the different schools of jurisprudence Scholars mentioned [different] types of guardianship:",
    "Answer": "Guardianship over the general affairs of a personguardianship with the authority to compel the authority to initiate marriage. This type of guardianship is consistent with the above mentioned definition since it involves executing the guardian's will over his charge. Ibn 'Abdin states in Dar al-Mukhtar that \"guardianship is executing one's will over another.\"The Hanafis:Hanafi scholars maintain that guardianship with the authority to initiate marriage cannot be established except over minors because of their young age; therefore this kind of guardianship cannot — under any circumstances — be exercised over an adult female. According to them, it is recommended and preferable for an adult female to have a guardian. They associate guardianship to the order of guardianship outlined by the laws of inheritance. Al-Zayla'i mentions in Tabyeen al-Haqa`iq: \"Guardianship in marriage is of two types: The first, the guardianship over a sane adult female whether or not she is a virgin, is recommended and preferable. The second, the guardianship over a female minor with the authority to initiate marriage without her consent whether or not she is a virgin.\" He [also] mentions in Kinz al-Haqa`iq: \"A guardian has the right to marry off a minor, male or female; the guardian is a universal guardian occupying the same order as that in inheritance.\"The Malikis and the Shafi'is:The Malikis and Shafi'is maintain that guardianship, with the authority to initiate marriage without the consent of the female, is exercised over both young and ols a virgins. While the Malikis maintain that only the father is entitled to guardianship, the Shafi'is maintain that both the father and grandfather are entitled to guardianship. Citing Malik, al-Baji, the great Maliki scholar, mentions in Al-Muntaqa that only the father can compel a virgin to marry, not her grandfather nor anyone else.Imam al-Suyuti, the Shafi'i scholar, mentions in Al-Ashbah wa Al-Nadha`ir: \"Certain regulations have been outlined concerning the father and paternal grandfather, among which is guardianship with the authority to initiate marriage for a son or daughter without their consent\".The Shafi'i scholar, Al-Khatib, mentions in Mughni al-Muhtaj: \"A father has the right to marry a young or old virgin without her consent [although] it is better to seek her permission; he does not have the right to marry a non-virgin except with her consent. If she is prepubescent, then she is not to marry until she attains puberty. In the absence of the father, the grandfather takes his place.\"The chosen opinion for this fatwaThe Egyptian Court of Cassation, appeal no. 56 for the year ….., in the Court of Family Affairs on the session held on 15 February 1994 implemented the Hanafi opinion which has also been chosen for this fatwa. The court ruling states that the conditions for a guardian marrying a sane adult female are:seeking her consent sexual maturity.Impermissibility of marrying one's daughter to an insane man Imam al-Shafi'i maintains that it is impermissible for a man to marry his daughter to an insane man. In his famous work on Islamic law, Al-Umm, he mentions that: \"It is unlawful for a father to marry his daughter to someone suffering from leprosy, vitiligo, insanity, or someone whose testicles has been severed, though he be a suitable match. The reason is if she was an adult, she would have had the right to choose if she had known of these defects in advance.”The RulingIt is impermissible to marry off an 18-year old female without her consent even if it were to a suitable match. In addition marriage to a person who is considered insane such as to a permanently retarded person is another reason for the objection to the validity of this marriage. This is because marrying an adult female to such a person is impermissible except with her consent.Allah the Almighty knows best"

    "Question": "I am a Muslim convert who fell in love with a Muslim man but we are from different nationalities. He proposed to me yet his family is adamant on refusing to agree on his marriage to a girl from another nationality. It has been two years now and I don’t know what to do. Could you advise me please?",
    "Answer": "Dear sister,Marriage in Islam is a sacred union that is based on mercy, love, respect and mutual understanding along with intellectual compatibility and social adequacy. Inter cultural marriages usually face the problem of differences in the cultural background of the two couple; for this reason the families of one or the two parties usually act conservatively and hesitantly out of fear of potential problems resulting from these cultural differences. As legitimate as their fears might be, the role of parents should be limited to giving advice out of care and love but not out of force or compulsion.This means that the ultimate decision of getting married should be determined only by the two of you and if the parents of your man adamantly refuse to give their blessings, then your man should decide whether he wants to take matters into his own hand and marry you or he prefers to find another girl who gets the blessings of his family first.Islam does not differentiate between people based on their nationalities, skin color or cultural background as the only scale for virtue among people is by piety. Therefore people should not be subjected to discrimination in treatment based on their ethnic origin.I understood from your long letter that the man you love is your co worker and you have been seeing each other for two years now with no shred of hope that his family would change their minds. I would advise you to continue praying to God to guide your heart to what is best for you and to ask your man to make up his mind and take his decision so you can both live happily together or for each of you to start a new life and go into separate ways. May God grant you happiness in this life and the hereafter. Amin"

    "Question": "I love a guy. He also showed interest. but when I became really serious he put off. but remained in contact with me. Three days back he got engaged. I desperately love him.",
    "Answer": "Dear questioner,Love is a beautiful sentiment and a divine gift that God places in the heart of people so they love one another and express their care for each other. Through this divine love all kinds of relationships are in place be it the love of parents to their children, love between spouses, love among friends and relatives, love of goodness to others etc… Falling in love with someone cannot be called complete love unless this love is mutual and not an infatuation of one party to another. In your letter, you strongly expressed your flowing love for this guy and your constant prayers to God to join you both in marriage but when you talked about his feelings, you only referred to him as having an “interest” in you. Interest does not necessarily mount to love and his sentiments for you could have been simply an admiration which ceased and did not grow into love whereas your feelings for him unilaterally developed to love.This might explain why he got engaged to another girl as your attachment for him was obviously not mutual. This is the first scenario. As for the second scenario, he might have actually loved you but for one reason or another he could not take this relationship to the official level. In all cases, this leaves you with the same result which is that you fell in love with the wrong person because for love to nourish it needs constant care and affection which has to be mutual otherwise love simply dies.Your constant prayers to get married to a man who don’t love you back or not keen enough to make the relationship official is praying for a potential misery as any relationship that lacks love between the two parties is like a dry tree that lacks water and becomes vulnerable and potentially falls down and couldn't stand for the blowing wind of life.Putting your faith and trust in God holds the underlying meaning of submission and contentment with His decisions and entails the feelings of serenity and satisfaction with His destiny whatever it maybe. You have to remember that God is the best planner and if this man was the right one for you, you would have been married to him by now. Sometimes we hold tight to things which lead to our future dismay and through the mercy of God alone He guides us to what suits us best. So my advise to you is to hold tight to God and place your heart in submission to His will as He only wills what is best for you and reassure yourself that the right man for you will not make you suffer the agony and the pain of separation because he will love you back and you will feel in your heart the pleasure of mutual love."

He is to do this without using coercion or violence but is to use the Islamic manner of raising children.There is no relation between wearing the hijab and financial support — it is obligatory upon a father to support his daughter whether she wears the hijab or not.One of the aspects of mercy in Islam is that it does not make neglect of Islamic duties a reason to withdraw financial support.

    "Answer": "Yes, this is permissible so long as it does not lead to anything prohibited by Islamic law.According to the practice of generations of Muslims from among the predecessors and successors, the mere presence of males and females in the same place is not prohibited in itself. Rather, the prohibition concerns the manner of their gathering if it contradicts the rulings of Islamic law. This includes, for example, women uncovering what they have been commanded to cover in Islamic law, gathering to commit an abominable act or sitting in unlawful privacy with the opposite sex. As for the prohibited mixing between the opposite sexes, it is that which involves touching and physical contact and not merely being present in the same place.RulingIt is permissible to attend such gatherings and none will be blameworthy except whoever exceeds the limits of Islamic law.

What is the ruling for this since she did spend the night at her father's house?",
    "Answer": "The inquirer's intention on both the first and second occasions may be interpreted as the husband wishing to suspend conjugal relations with his wife on either a temporary or a permanent basis. Zihar (it involves the husband likening his wife to his mother or sister, thus the prohibition of continuing conjugal relations with her such as by saying: \"You are to me like my mother's or sister's back.\" It does not constitute divorce but requires expiation) has not been affected if he intended to temporarily refrain from engaging in sexual relations with his wife. But if he intended permanency, it is considered zihar. The expiation for zihar He must fast two consecutive months. If he cannot, he is to feed sixty poor persons.The rulingSince the inquirer made expiation after he uttered the first statement, it is incumbent upon him to make expiation for the second because the act upon which he made zihar conditional occurred.

    "Question": "A question about a registered threefold divorce. The inquirer was told that her third divorce was not considered effective because it occurred during her menstrual period when she was going through a difficult time psychologically. Is this correct?",
    "Answer": "It is stipulated in Islamic jurisprudence that a divorce verbalized using plain words is effected once the divorce statement is uttered by the husband, whether the wife is in her menses or in a state of purity, for it severs the bond of marriage and waives conjugal rights. Divorce is therefore not restricted to any particular time.Since the Qur`anic verses mentioning divorce are general and there are no textual evidences to restrict them, it is obligatory to maintain that divorce in such a case has been effected.Regarding what has been mentioned by way of a prohibition of divorce during a wife's menstrual period that is due to an extrinsic factor, namely causing harm to the wife by forcing her to prolong her 'idda (post marital waiting period). For this reason, a husband who divorces his wife during her menstrual period is sinful although divorce is considered as having been effected. This is attested to by the hadith in which the Prophet censured Ibn 'Umar for divorcing his wife during her menstrual period. Ibn 'Umar asked the Prophet, \"O Messenger of Allah! What would your opinion be if I give my wife a threefold divorce [during her menstrual period]?\" The Prophet replied, \"You would disobey your Lord and she will become irrevocably divorced from you.\" The rulingBased on this, a divorce verbalized by the words \"You are divorced\" during a wife's menstrual period is effective. In conjunction with the two previous divorces, it amounts to a threefold divorce and therefore the wife becomes irrevocably separated from her husband. If the marriage had been consummated, it is unlawful for the man to remarry his ex-wife except after she marries another man with a valid marriage contract that fulfills all its integrals and conditions, consummates the marriage, separates from her new husband either through divorce or his death and her waiting period expires. It is only then that her previous husband can take her back with a new marriage contract and dowry after obtaining her consent.The above answers what was mentioned in the question and Allah the Almighty knows best."

My question is regarding what's our right at divorce, the wedding gift (shabka), the normal gifts and El-Mahr.. what is he entilted for and what is mine.Thank you for your help",
    "Answer": "A divorcee is entitled to the following:MahrIt is established in Islamic law [Shari'ah] that divorced woman is entitled to receive her entire dowry [mahr] if marriage has been consummated. This includes the deferred marital payment [mu'akhar Al-Sadaq]. If her mahr has not been previously indicated, then she is to receive mahr offered to her like of divorced women.-Waiting period expensesThese are the expenses owed to the divorcée during her waiting period; they include all kinds of expenses that a wife is entitled to during her marriage. The judge's decision is based upon the wife's assertion on the duration of her waiting period and on the condition that it does not exceed one year from the date of divorce. This is the procedure followed by Egyptian law which is based on the preponderant opinion of scholars. The sum is determined by the judge according to what he sees suitable to the case before him.AlimonyA divorcée is entitled to receive alimony provided she was not the one who asked for divorce or she was its cause such as Khul' or Ibraa' (i.e. to waive all her financial rights in return for obtaining divorce). It is prohibited for the husband to mistreat his wife intentionally to push her to ask for divorce and waiving all her rights as per the words of God the Almighty:And do not make difficulties for them in order to take [back] part of what you gave them. (An-Nisa': 19).The munificent Shari'ah made the estimation of the sum of alimony dependent upon the common practice [of the country] and on the husband's financial capability. God Almighty says:But make fair provision for them, the rich according to his means and the poor according to his—this is a duty for those who do good (Al-Baqarah, 236).Divorced women shall also have such maintenance as is considered fair: this is a duty for those who are mindful of God (Al-Baqarah, 241).This is the ruling implanted by Egyptian courts. The sum takes into consideration the prosperity or poverty of the husband and is estimated by the judge according to what he sees suitable for the case brought before him.This applies when divorce was without the consent of the woman or she was not its cause. On the contrary, if the woman asked for divorce without suffering any harm from her husband, she is either to do the following:- She is to file for Khul', in which case she is to return him the entire mahr and mu'akhr. She is not entitled to it if he did not receive it in the first place, or- The spouses agree on divorce without a need to the court, in which case rights are granted according to mutual agreement between them.God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling in Islam for euthanasia i.e. what ruling do scholars of the religion give when a patient asks the doctor to terminate his life because of excruciating pain or disability or where the doctor himself decides that it is better for the patient to die than to live disabled?",
    "Answer": "God, Sublime is He, is the most merciful of all with His servants. He is even more merciful to one than one’s own mother, father, and everyone else. He says in His Quran:And your God is one God, no God but Him the most merciful (Quran 2:163).My mercy encompasses everything (7:156).The verses in the Noble Quran which revolve around this meaning are numerous, and the prophetic accounts mention this concept with vibrant clarity. A man from those who came before you suffered from a sore. When it caused him intense pain, he pulled an arrow from his quiver and lanced it. The blood did not stop flowing before he died. Your Lord said: ‘I have made Paradise forbidden for him’ (al-Bukhari and Muslim).The body that God gives an individual is not a personal possession. No one is free to dispose of their body as they wish because it is a trust for which they will be held accountable by the Creator (Glory to Him) on the Day of Judgment. In the Quran, God says: And do not throw yourselves to destruction and be good for God loves the good ones (2:195).A patient who asks his physician to end his life in one way or another is considered committing suicide (may God protect us). In their collections of authentic hadiths, al-Bukhari and Muslim related through Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of God said: Whoever hurls himself off a mountain and kills himself will be [repeatedly] hurled into the flames of Hellfire, where he will abide eternally. Whoever drinks poison and kills himself, will be in the Hellfire eternally; his poison will be in his hand and he will drink from it. Whoever kills himself with an iron blade, the blade will be in his hands and he will stab himself in the stomach in Hellfire eternally (al-Bukhari).As for a physician terminating the life of a patient for a reason he personally deems justifiable, it is – may God protect us! – the unlawful taking of human life. Our Lord, all praise to Him says: Whoever kills a believer deliberately, the punishment for him is hell, and there he will remain: God is angry with him, and rejects him, and has prepared a tremendous torment for him (Quran 4:93).Our master, the Messenger of God said: The blood of a Muslim who testifies that there is no deity other than God and that I am the Messenger of God is not lawful [to shed] except for one of three reasons: [taking] a life for a life, a fornicator who has the means to be chaste (Ar. al-thayyib al-zani), and someone who leaves Islam and abandons the majority (of Muslims).Based on this and in reference to the question: euthanasia in its two forms described in the question is not permissible. It is considered a major sin, as attested in a mass of Prophetic reports. It is incumbent upon physicians to know that there is no obedience to other people in a matter that constitutes a disobedience to God. Whenever a patient asks this of them, they must not accede, nor [are they to] kill another person without right. God the Almighty knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5953/my-son-is-travelling-for-jihad-without-my-permission",
    "Question": "Salam Alikom,",
    "Answer": "Jihad in lexical term means exerting one’s utmost effort and it has more than one level. The first and the major one is jihad against oneself through purifying the heart from maladies, whims and caprices. The second level is the one that you inquire about indicates a combative sense which is jihad fi sabeel God or exerting one’s effort for the sake of God. Scholars name that jihad against one’s self as the major Jihad because it continues with the person thorough out his life and not only limited with the time period of the actual war in which he performs jihad.As a matter of fact Muslim scholars believe that a Muslim won’t be able to perform jihad for the sake of God without starting with the bigger jihad which is jihad against one’s lower self. ‘Abdullah ibn Amr was once asked about his opinion on Jihad and he said start fighting your lower self first.As for your question about jihad in the combative sense, Jihad in principle is a collective obligation [fard kifaya]: It is one of the collective duties of the community as a whole. The organization of jihad is the responsibility of the rulers and politicians, who from their appointed positions are best able to calculate the consequences of such a crucial decision. Rulers examine the extent of the necessity that calls for defensive jihad. All the aspects of the decision for combative jihad and their ramifications are examined and are subject to a scientific and factual study which carefully balances the benefits with the disadvantages. The enterprise must be free from cowardice, negligence, weakness, superficiality, or heedless emotions. No single group or person may initiate jihad on their own as this is considered transgressing against the ruler and may constitute more harm than good and such transgressors are held liable for the evils they have caused.In certain cases Jihad becomes an individual obligation [fard 'ayn]: Jihad becomes an individual obligation in countries where Muslim sanctuaries are attacked and their security threatened and is a duty upon the citizens to defend their country. Defensive jihad is not obligatory upon all Muslims; it is a communal obligation for those residing outside the territories under attack. If they are unable to repel the enemy, jihad becomes an individual obligation upon Muslims in neighboring countries. Implementing the legal ruling concerning in this manner requires:-Following the valid means which is the responsibility of those in authority, are aware of the political and military aspects, able to assess the need of jihad and calculate the ramifications, interests and disadvantages associated with the regional considerations and international treaties and are aware of the balance of international power. All of this requires:- Special considerations and meticulous military and political studies which have exhausted the possibility of a peaceful resolution which God Almighty commanded. He said:But if they incline towards peace, you [Prophet] must also incline towards it, and put your trust in God: He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing [Al-Anfal, 61];- preserving the security of Muslim countries, their citizens and interests.- the ability to face and endure the choice of war.- Jihad must be formally declared and clearly defined to prevent Muslims from falling prey to notorious organizations that may exploit their emotions and take advantage of their zeal to serve foreign goals in the name of jihad.So based upon the above clarification, the father has the right to prevent his son from travelling under the name of performing Jihad and the son is obliged to obey his father in this matter. Imam al Bukhari reported that sons are not allowed to perform jihad without the prior permission of their parents and this was authenticated by numerous prophetic traditions and in one of them a man came to Prophet Muhammad seeking his permission to perform Jihad so the Prophet asked him “are your parents alive?” so the man replied “yes” in response the Prophet said “through them perform jihad”. In other words one should exert his utmost efforts (jihad) to take care of his/her parents.The majority of Muslim scholars prohibited performing jihad for sons without the prior permission of their Muslim parents because taking care of one’s parents is an individual obligation whereas performing jihad is a collective one. God knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5954/no-compulsion-in-religion-vs-jihad-a-missing-balance",
    "Question": "I am a new convert to Islam and I have read in Islamic sources that Jihad is obligatory till judgment day. At the same time I understand that there is no compulsion in religion then what is the meaning of Jihad? Also should Muslims wage wars against non Muslims every where and slaughter them? How do we balance between the concept of no compulsion in religion and between the following verse “And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, God is Forgiving and Merciful. (9:5) And the prophetic hadith which says “I was commanded to fight people until they attest that there is no god but God…” Please clarify.",
    "Answer": "The original state which guides the relationship between Muslims and non Muslims is coexistence and peace not war. God says in the Quran, “God does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, God loves those who act justly”. 60:8God also says “And if they incline to peace, then incline to it [also] and rely upon God. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing.” (8:61)Therefore the legal evidence from both the Quran and the Sunnah along with the Muslims’ actions along centuries indicate that they opened people’s minds and hearts before entering their lands and this understanding does not defy the concept of Jihad and its role in fighting oppression and elevating injustice. In other words, it is a mutual fighting and not one sided killing which means that non Muslims are not fought because of the mere fact that they are non Muslims. For this reason Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) prohibited desecrating place of worship of non Muslims or subjecting them to any kind of harm and even the non Muslim militant combatants who fight against Muslims in a war, if they back off from oppression and tyranny then Muslims have no right to continue fighting them. God says, “Fight in the way of God those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. God does not like transgressors.” (2:190)Therefore Jihad is a noble war to fight injustice and lift oppression and tyranny and not a shooting spree of individuals as some uninformed people try to promote. If this noble war shifted away from legal guidelines which include all the necessary conditions, restrictions and elements which if applied would qualify fighting as an eligible noble war- if these rules are not applied then jihad is deemed illegal and simply turns to corruption on earth or betrayal and treachery because not every war is jihad and not all killings in war is permissible. Waging wars against non Muslims every where is not part of Islam or its noble teachings as this understanding is a sheer aberration from the correct authentic way of understanding the concept of Jihad in Islam. As for the above mentioned verse which says, “and when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, God is Forgiving and Merciful.” (9:5)This verse has to do with those who breached their covenant, fought, killed, betrayed Muslims and had calculative moves to annihilate them and thus God commands Muslims to defend themselves against polytheists and God described these polytheists in the later verses as “They do not observe toward a believer any pact of kinship or covenant of protection. And it is they who are the transgressors.” (9:10)As for the prophetic hadith in which the Prophet said, ““I was commanded to fight people until they attest that there is no god but God…”, the word “people” here falls under the legal maxim of “ a general statement which is meant to be restricted” as the Prophet was addressing the rebel outcasts who defied the state system and try to demolish it through fighting and betraying Muslims and this kind of seceders are tried according to international law under the crime of great treachery which is not pardoned. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) opened the door of pardon for seceders by saying “if they did all that- attesting there is no god but God and Muhammad is his prophet, performing prayers and giving zakat- then their lives and money are spared and their judgment is left to God.” This means that fighting seceders was not because of their disbelief in God as freedom of belief is secured and guaranteed in Islam but rather fighting was because of their troubling deeds and disturbing actions which breached the security of the general system of the society within which they live. We also need to differentiate between two important concepts. The first of which is jihad and irjaf or terrorism. Jihad for the sake of God is a noble Islamic concept which has a capacious meaning in the Islamic perspective. Jihad as a term fits to mean fighting against one’s lower self, against Satan and against whims and it is also used to fight against enemies who inflict injustice and practice oppression and tyranny. This last type of jihad has its own conditions without which it becomes impermissible.The principle in war is that it should be launched with the authorization of, and under the banner of, the Muslim ruler; it is imperative that the decision to declare war is based on his own reasoning and his subjects must obey him. A ruler is authorized to declare war due to his knowledge of evident and hidden matters, the consequences of actions and the interest of his people. For this reason, a ruler is authorized to declare war and agree to domestic or international treaties as soon as he assumes office. In turn, he does not issue decisions based on [personal] whims.The Muslim ruler declares war only after consulting specialists in every relevant field such as technical and military specialists and political consultants who are indispensable to military strategy. The luminary al-Bahutī said in Sharh Muntahā al-Iradāt: “It is prohibited to [launch an] attack without the ruler's permission because he is responsible for making the decision of declaring war. [This is because] he has access to all the information pertaining to the enemy. [His permission is mandatory] except if [Muslims] are taken by surprise by non-Muslim enemies and fear their threat. [Only] then is it permissible to fight the attackers without the ruler's permission because of the general benefit therein.”It is not justifiable in Islamic law to make individual reckless uncalculated decisions of waging wars because of which destruction follows suit let alone those explosive operations which has nothing to do with either Islamic jihad or any noble war. Jihad in Islamic law includes preparing armies, securing borders, along with preparing a power of deterrence which is used to prevent bloodshed and is used as a tool for maintaining peace and keeping a balance of power, God says,” And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know [but] whom Allah knows. And whatever you spend in the cause of Allah will be fully repaid to you, and you will not be wronged.” 8:60Jihad in its combative sense is not meant for the purpose of killing non Muslims unlike the claims of those fear mongers who portrayed that the original purpose of jihad is to shed the blood of non Muslims but the authentic Muslim scholars clarified that advocacy for Islam suffices and replaces the role of jihad which requires entering non Muslims’ lands and as long as advocacy is allowed and bears its fruits then resorting to jihad is not needed and killing non Muslims is not a purpose in itself as jihad is only a means to an end and not an end in itself.What those fear mongers promote is actually terrorism or in Arabic it is called (irjaf) and not jihad, as God says in the Quran, “If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease and those who spread rumors in al-Madinah do not cease, We will surely incite you against them; then they will not remain your neighbors therein except for a little. Accursed wherever they are found, [being] seized and massacred completely. [This is] the established way of Allah with those who passed on before; and you will not find in the way of Allah any change.” (33: 60-62)The term irjaf as the proper translation into Arabic for terrorism is more favored. “This word, which denotes subversion and scaremongering to bring quaking and commotion to society is derived from the root (r / j / f), which means to quake, tremble, be in violent motion, convulse, or shake.” This term occurs in the Qur’an in this context in one telling verse: “Now; if the hypocrites do not give over, and those in whose hearts there is sickness and they make commotion (murjifun) in the city, We shall assuredly urge thee against them.” [33:60]. In the context of this verse, al-Qurtubi, the renowned thirteenth-century Qur’anic commentator and Maliki ījurist, explains the meaning of irjaf with respect to “shaking of the hearts (tahrik al-qulub),” noting the root’s corresponding application to “the shaking of the earth (rajafat al-ard).” Within an Islamic context, connecting this metaphor of creating commotion on earth (murjifun) with that of shaking hearts (tahrik al-qulub) connotes that those who do wrong are in fact acting against the wishes of the Divine.The term murjifun (singular, murjif), as well as the equivalent rendering irjafiyyun (singular, irjafi), is a far better translation of terrorists ... Of course, there are multiple ways to bring about such intense commotion to society, but all of these fall under the term Irjaf. From a linguistic perspective, the term unambiguously connotes the cowardice, deceit, and betrayal associated with terrorism in striking from behind.Terrorism is conducted under many guises such as accusing the ruler or the whole state of falling into disbelief (kufr) or accusing a certain group of people of being disbelievers or shedding the blood of Muslims under the motto of commanding good and forbidding evil or permitting the blood shed of non Muslims in their own countries or other baseless claims which go against the moderate Islamic teachings. This warped logic and false understanding led to the appearance of the outcasts or the Kharajites during the time of the Prophet’s companions and this phenomenon was spread through out history until our modern time. These fanatic groups justify for themselves shedding blood and desecrating places of worship and spreading corruption on earth through killing tourists or through explosive operations or other forms of killing which result from misleading terrorizing methodology. Islam calls for resisting this kind of corruptive behavior and fighting those who adopt such fanatic methodology to prevent them from harming both Muslims and non Muslims. Calling such acts of corruption and terrorism as jihad is a pure act of deceit which aims at tarnishing the image of Islam.In our modern time, official entrance to countries is organized through entrance and departure visas which guarantees for its holder safety and security of his life and money according to international law. The permission of entering a country is a token which guarantees safety and security for the holder of this permission and for this reason when non Muslims enter Muslim countries for any reason such as tourism, his safety is automatically guaranteed and he should not be subjected to any danger. Muslim scholars went to an extent that if someone thought that he is safe and secure, then the state should act based on his thought and guarantee him safety and security even if he was a militant combatant."

    "Question": "I embraced Islam recently and before my conversion, I used to earn some money from painting pet animals as I am gifted in painting. But I am not sure if this is allowed in Islam and I tried repetitively to paint natural paintings but my talent lies in painting animals. So am I allowed to continue painting animals because it is my only hobby which pleases me?",
    "Answer": "Painting animals and humans is allowed according to the opinion of a group of scholars. This is the established opinion of the Maliki school and was approved of Ibn Himdan from the Hanbali school. They opined that prohibition is relevant to statues which have height, width and depth. Ibn Abi Shaybah reported this opinion in his book (al Musanaf) which was attributed to Imam al Qasem ibn Muhammad who was a renowned scholar from the Tabi’in (generations following the Prophet’s companions). Imam Nawawi said that some of the ancestors favored the opinion that it is prohibited to draw anything which has shadow but if it did not reflect a shadow, it would be deemed permissible to draw it and this opinion is invalid. Ibn Hajar in (Fath al Bari) commented on this statement by saying that deeming the previous opinion as invalid needs some consideration.Therefore, this issue is one of the controversial issues and the Muslim is not blamed to favor any of the presented opinions because whenever differences occur in juristic issues, capaciousness followed suit. Therefore it is permissible for you to draw humans, pet animals and so on whether you draw from your imagination or from nature or from photographs. There is no legal impediment for you to continue drawing and excelling your talent. May God favor you with his blessings."

    "Question": "Is it permissible to place bets on football games? And if the term “bets” changed to “expectations” would this make it permissible? What is the ruling if these expectations are built on meticulous researches and thorough efforts?",
    "Answer": "First of all we need to differentiate between two different cases:The first case is the case which is legally prohibited by all scholars which is betting and gambling. This case occurs when two people place their bets on something that could or couldn’t happen and one says to another if this thing happened then you owe me so and so and if it didn’t happen I owe you so and so and this kind of bets is called risk tasking.The second case is beneficial contests which are legally permissible and the winning prize comes from the money of the organizers or any other independent entity to be offered to the winners. It is not legally permissible according to the unanimous opinion of all scholars that the money of the prize to be collected from all contesters as each of them would pay some money and the winner takes all the money which consists of the money he paid and the money which others paid as well. The reason for this impermissibility is that this type falls directly under the legally prohibited gambling. As for the money that is paid by all the contesters which fall under administrational and organizational fees, they are permissible because this money has nothing to do with the actual prize.This is the clear difference between the two cases of prohibited gambling and legal contests because changing names is not the point as juristic rulings are bound to actions and not merely with its names. Therefore if the offered prizes in contests are given after evaluating the thorough researches and meticulous studies which are offered by different contesters and not given based on the accurateness of expectations, then it is legally permissible.On the other hand if these prizes are given based on the correctness of the expectations then it falls under the prohibited gambling."

    "Question": "What is the ruling on the money I pay for breeding my mares to studs, a service I may also offer in the future? Please note that the choice of pedigree is based on established international standards to maintain their purity and, therefore, mares can only be bred to stallions from the Egyptian Agricultural Organization or from private stud farms, both of which demand a fee for their services I raise Arabian horses and breed my mares to stallions from private stud farms or the Egyptian Agricultural Organization (affiliated to the Ministry of Agriculture, the authority responsible for Arabian horses in Egypt) for a fee. Please note that I bear the cost of maintaining, feeding, and treatment of these horses. In the near future I will have my own studs.",
    "Answer": "There is no disagreement among scholars on the permissibility of loaning stallions for breeding. It is permissible for the stud's owner to accept money for loaning his stallion without a prior agreement for remuneration. This is based on the hadith narrated by Anas Ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) who said, \"A man from Kilab asked the Prophet about 'asb al-fahl but the Prophet did not permit it. So the man said, 'O Messenger of Allah! We [lend] our stallions for breeding and receive a recompense.' Thereupon the Prophet permitted such financial remunerations\" [Reported by Al-Tirmidhi who declared it fair].Definition of 'asb al-fahlThere is a scholarly difference on the meaning of'asb al-fahl. Some scholars have maintained that it is the price paid for the stallion's semen while others maintained that it is money received for renting out the stallion to mate with mares.Scholarly opinionsReports from the sunnah forbid renting stallions for breeding or selling their semen. The majority of scholars have maintained that this injunction is tantamount to a prohibition. Based on this, they maintained its prohibition because the stallion's semen cannot be evaluated and its quantity and deliverability cannot be pre-determined. The Hanbalis: Hanbali scholars have maintained that it is permissible for a person to breed his mares to stallions for a fee if he cannot find anyone to offer this service for free. They based their opinion on the need to breed mares to stallions for the permissible benefit accrued from it. According to them, only the recipient of the fee is blameworthy. This is likewise the position of 'Ata` Ibn Abu Rabah from among the Successors.The Malikis: Maliki scholars—in an opinion that agrees with the most correct opinion of the Shafi'is, the Hanbalis Abu al-Khattab and Abu al-Wafa` Ibn 'Aqil and the Successors al-Hasan al-Basri and Ibn Sirin maintained the permissibility of renting stallions to mate with mares though only for a known period or a determined number of times. They based their opinion on the need for the benefit accrued, analogizing it to hiring a wet nurse and the permissibility of loaning studs to mate with mares. They interpreted the prohibition mentioned in the above hadith as renting stallions for an unspecified period such as until the stallion impregnates the mare.The Hanbali scholar, Ibn Qudama, mentioned inAl-Mughni (207/6), \"It has been reported that Malik maintains its permissibility. Ibn 'Aqil said that he [likewise] maintains its permissibility because it is a contract for the benefit accrued from the stallion, i.e. impregnating the mares; the outcome is planned and it is most likely that the stallion will breed the mare. This is tantamount to hiring a wet nurse to feed an infant. Elaborating on the opinion of the majority of scholars he went on to say, \"Based on this, it is impermissible for a person to receive a fee for 'asab al-fahl due to the reasons previously mentioned though it is not prohibited for the person commissioning the service since he spends his money to meet a permissible need. This is not forbidden contrary to profiting from cupping. This is similar to one who profits from cupping. Though it is offensive to receive money from cupping, the Prophet paid the person who performed cupping on him. Similarly, the Companions permitted the purchase of copies of the Qur`an though they deemed their sale disliked.\"The Maliki scholar, Ibn Rushd, stated in Bidayat al-Mujtahid (224/2), \"Malik maintained the permissibility of renting studs from camels, cows, and other animals for breeding for a determined number of times. Abu Hanifah and al-Shafi'i maintained otherwise."

God Most High says,“But if anyone is forced to eat such things by hunger, rather than desires or excess, he commits no sin: God is most merciful and forgiving” [2: 173].Commenting on the Hanafi opinion on the permissibility of abortion before 120 days of gestation i.e. before the fetus is ensouled, Ibn Abidin said that no compensation is owed when a woman [who has been injured] passes flesh without discernible human features and she is not blameworthy.2- The Shari’ah has established that it is permissible to use an object that can be used for unlawful purposes provided it is not restricted to unlawful usage. Based on this, it is permissible to deal with anything that has dual-purpose, whether through selling, renting, or so forth. The onus for its use is on the user—if he uses it for lawful purposes, then it is permissible; if he uses it for prohibited purposes, the prohibition applies to him."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5968/the-ruling-of-keeping-the-beard",
    "Question": "What is the ruling on keeping the beard?",
    "Answer": "The command for keeping the beard has come from various hadith such as, “distinguish yourself from the disbelievers, keep your beards and shorten your moustaches.” The jurists have disputed the nature of the command in this hadith, is the command used for an obligatory act, or a recommended act? The majority of jurists have ruled that it is obligatory, but the jurists of the Shafi‘i school have ruled that it is recommended. The Shafi‘i jurists have dealt with this issue extensively such as Zakariyya al-Ansari who stated, “it is reprehensible to pluck out ones facial hair once it grows it being preferable for it to grow giving one a noble face.” Imam al-Ramli has commented on this sentence by saying, “his statement ‘it is reprehensible to pluck out…’ meaning the beard and likewise shaving it. Therefore the statement of al-Hilmi in his Minhaj that it is impermissible to shave the beard or the eyebrow is weak.” Imam Ibn Hajar al-Haytami has stated, “Concerning the beard there are actions which are considered reprehensible such as plucking it, shaving it, as well as the eyebrow.” This has been confirmed by Imam Ibn Qasim al-‘Ibadi in his gloss on Tuhfat al-Muhtaj in which he states, “our teachers have stated that shaving the beard is reprehensible.” The noble scholar al-Bujayrmi has stated in his gloss on al-Khatib’s commentary that, “shaving the beard is a reprehensible act even from a man and it is not prohibited.” The reason he stated “even from a man” is not to be in contradistinction from a women, but rather it is in contradistinction to a young man as the original discussion revolves around the ruling of a shaving once the facial hair has come in, i.e. in a young man. The discussion follows that the initial growing of the facial hair is not a condition, and a grown man shaving his head also falls into the ruling.The reprehensibility of shaving the beard is not just found amongst the Shafi‘i school. We find that al-Qadi ‘Iyad from the Maliki school has stated that, “it is reprehensible to shave the beard, pluck it, or burn it.” As for those jurists who argued that keeping the beard is mandatory, they have taken another meaning from the aforementioned hadith. They are of the opinion that shaving the beard is a negative trait, and goes against the general appearance of a man during their times giving him a certain measure. Imam al-Ramli has stated in his discussion of castigation (t‘azir) that it should not be done by shaving a man’s beard as this is a form of deformation and his children will also be shamed by this.” In legal matters if a command is attached to a custom the command changes from obligation to recommendation and this is attested to in many instances where jurists have taken hadith with clear commands but their commands were understood to be recommended acts not obligatory ones. An example of this is, “Change your grey hairs so you do not imitate your enemies, and the best change is henna and concealing.” As changing or altering one’s grey hair or not is not considered a negative act in society, the jurists have understood the command to be a recommendation and not an obligation. Accordingly have Muslim jurists dealt with such issues. Older jurists used to consider anyone who wore Western clothing as leaving Islam. However, when this practice became widespread and commonplace amongst Muslims they changed their opinions. Therefore the ruling concerning the beard during the time of the pious ancestors, during which both Muslims and non-Muslims used to keep their beards, was one of dispute with the majority of jurists saying it was mandatory to keep the beard and therefore prohibited to shave it and the Shafi‘i jurists who said shaving the beard was reprehensible as keeping it was only a sunnah practice. Accordingly, we rule that especially today when customs have changed, we must adhere to the Shafi‘i opinion which states that shaving the beard is a reprehensible act and keeping it is a sunnah act that entails praise and reward as long as one keeps it well and is presentable. And God is most high most knowledgeable."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5969/the-ruling-of-smoking",
    "Question": "What is the ruling of smoking?",
    "Answer": "Smoking is the intake of the tobacco plant by burning it and inhaling its smoke. Tobacco (al-tibgh) is a foreign word that entered the Arabic language without being changed, and it has been confirmed by Majma’ al-Lughah al-‘Arabiyah. Tobacco is a member of the nightshade family and it is used for smoking, snuff, and chew, and there is a kind that is grown for decoration. It is American in its origins and was unknown to the Arabs of old. It made its appearance in the late tenth/early eleventh century H.E. The English were the first to bring it to the lands of the Ottoman Empire, a Jew who claimed he was a physician was the first to bring it to North Africa, and then it was brought to Egypt, Arabia, Indian, and most Muslim countries. Its names include: al-dukhan, al-tatan, and al-timbaq, but this last name is predominantly used to refer to a particular thick kind of tobacco that is not rolled but is smoked in a water pipe.Similar to tobacco in the way it smokes and burns is al-Tibaq which is a plant that is ma’mar from the fasila al-murakibat al-anbubiya al-zuhr, and is known to the Arabs, unlike tobacco. Tibaq is an arabized word. In al-Mu’jam al-Wasit it says, “al-Tibaq is smoke (al-dukhan), it is smoked rolled or chopped up.” The ruling of smoking revolves around harm. If the harm that the Shari’ah prohibits is realized then it is forbidden for that reason, and if it is not realized then it is disliked or permissible. This was the reason for the difference of opinion among the scholars in the past since medicine continues to discover new things and it informs us of the harms of smoking day after day. Modern medicine in our day has arrived at the conclusion that smoking is extremely harmful to ones health and it consists of a debilitating substance.According to ‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit one of the judicial rulings of the Prophet was, “[There should be] no harm and no harming.” General and particular axioms of jurisprudence were based on this like, “Harm is to be removed,” and “Repelling harm takes precedence over promoting benefit.” According to Umm Salmah, “The Prophet forbade every intoxicant and debilitating substance.” Based on this let it be known that the shari’ah has forbidden extensive harm, and smoking causes extensive harm to people’s health as has been ascertained by medical experts; the shari’ah forbids every debilitating substance, and tobacco, a well as all plants that are smoked debilitates people’s nerves; the shari’ah forbids wasting money, which is spending it on that which has no benefit, on that which causes harm, rather, as has been authentically reported according to the Prophet, “God dislikes for you ‘it is said,’ ‘so and so says,’ wasting money, and excessive questioning.” For this reason it is our opinion that smoking is a bad habit and is religiously forbidden, and we ask God to turn towards those who have been afflicted with it. And God is Most High and Knows best."

    "Question": "The question concerns treating women with some medications, such as Clomid and others, containing a hormone that directly stimulates the ovaries. This hormone is extracted from the urine of women over 40.",
    "Answer": "According to the opinion of Hanafi and Shaf'i scholars, it is permissible to take medicine made from ritually impure substances under the supervision of experts whenever pure ones are unavailable. Scholarly opinionsCiting some Hanafi scholars, Ibn Abidin stated in Al-Hashiya (4/215): \"It is permissible for an ill person to drink urine, blood or consume the meat of an unslaughtered dead animal for medication if a Muslim medical expert informs him that [the impure substance] is a cure and if a permissible substitute is unavailable. There are two opinions if the physician informs the patient that such a cure will hasten recovery.\"Al-Khatib Ash-Shirbni wrote in Mughni Al-Muhatj (4/234): \"It is permissible to take anti venom and the like mixed with alcohol which has become completely indistinguishable (such that no color, taste, or odor remains) if a cure made from pure substances is unavailable. Examples include medication with ritually impure substances such as snake meat and urine which are permissible even if for the purpose of hastening recovery. [This permissibility] rests upon the prescription of an upright Muslim physician or the patient's own knowledge of the [healing properties] of the impure substance.\" Al-Haitami said in Al-Tuhfa (9/170): \"It is permissible to use alcohol (which has become completely indistinguishable) with medicine for medication similar to the permissibility of using ritually impure substances in their original form if the patient himself knows or is informed by an upright Muslim physician of the [healing] benefits of that particular substance and if a pure substitute is unavailable.\" The ruling It is permissible to take Clomid and similar drugs under the supervision of an upright medical expert who will weigh between their effect on stimulating the ovaries and the resulting harm of not taking them. He is responsible before Allah Almighty of his decision because of the Qur`anic verse which states, Ask those who have knowledge if you do not know [An-Nahl: 43]Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling in Islam of Muslims having mobile phones that have digital video cameras? What is the ruling of selling tight and revealing clothes to women? What is the ruling of selling television sets and satellite dishes?",
    "Answer": "There is no doubt that mobile phones, revealing clothing, television sets, and satellite dishes are all from the realm of things, and legal rulings are not connected to things in and of themselves, they are connected, rather, to their usage. Mobile phones, for example, have many beneficial usages, and they is the most noticeable leap forward in the field of communications. There is nothing wrong with increasing the capabilities of these devices by adding video cameras and the like. People can use video cameras for both permissible and impermissible things, regardless of whether it is attached to a mobile phone or stands alone, and regardless of whether it is large or small. The point is how it is used, because mobile phones or, more precisely, video cameras, have multiple uses: they can be used to reveal what should be kept private and spread loose morals, it can be used to serve Islam and spread beneficial knowledge, or it can be used things that are merely permissible.Similarly, women who buy revealing clothing can wear it in front of their husbands and still cover themselves in front of strangers, or they can wear it in front of strangers and thereby be committing sin. Similarly, televisions and satellite dishes can be used for cultural and educational purposes, or for that which is forbidden.It is well established in Islamic law that if the impermisibility of an action is not specified, it is permissible. After enumerating things whose impermisibility was not specified, like horned rams (al-kabsh al-natuh), fighting cocks (al-dik al-muqatil), and pigeons, al-Zayla’i said they were not impermissible, “Because their essences are not reprehensible, but the reprehensibility is in [some of their] uses.” Based on this it is permissible to sell and trade in anything that has more than one use, and the responsibility falls with the person that will use it; if they use it in a permissible manner, it is permissible, and if they use it in an impermissible manner, it is impermissible and they incur sin. And God is Most High and Knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling on using the holy Qur`an or the adhan as ringtones for mobile phones?",
    "Answer": "The holy Qur`an constitutes the words of Allah the Almighty which He revealed to the best of His messengers and creations, our master Muhammad . Allah commands us to respect the Qur`an, venerate it and handle it in a manner that dignifies it above everything else. None must touch the mus-haf (copy of the Qur`an) except one who is purified from both major and minor ritual states of impurity. Allah says, Indeed, it is a noble Qur'an. In a Register well-protected; none touch it except the purified. [Al-Waqi'a: 77-79]It is impermissible to place any book over a mus-haf because it is exalted and nothing should be placed on it. The superiority of the words of Allah over other words is like the superiority of Allah over His creatures. Therefore, it is inappropriate and disrespectful to set the Qur`an in place of mobile ringtones. This is because the sanctity and sublimity of the Qur`an elevate it above such uses. Allah says, And whoever honors the symbols of Allah - indeed, it is from the piety of hearts. [Al-Hajj: 32]Using verses of the holy Qur'an in place of mobile ringtones is tantamount to abusing the sanctity of the holy Qur`an which Allah revealed for remembrance and worship through its recitation. The Qur`an was not revealed to be misused in such a way as to debase its verses or remove it from its legal purpose. We are commanded to contemplate the verses of the Qur`an and fathom the meanings of its words. Using it in place of ringtones removes it from this legal purpose to the level of the mundane such as a mere telephone call. This drives one's attention away from contemplating its meanings to answering calls in addition to interrupting the verses and severing their meanings — sometimes even their inversion —upon stopping the recitation to answer the call.Likewise, it is improper to set the adhan as a mobile ringtone. The adhan was legislated to inform of the time of prayer and using it as a ringtone creates confusion, causing people to mistakenly assume that the time of prayer has entered. Furthermore, it involves inappropriately using it for purposes other than that for which it was prescribed. A person can—if he so wishes—instead use Islamic songs or prophetic eulogies that are suited to the short duration of ringtones. Allah's words are sacred and must be treated accordingly.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling for the personal use of articles belonging to mosques and exposing them to damage such as ladders, water for washing cars in front of the mosque and electricity to light homes?",
    "Answer": "It is established in Islamic law that it is impermissible to remove any item belonging to the mosque for personal use since they are endowments. Such endowments may include floor mats, electric bulbs, vacuum cleaners, miscellaneous cleaning items and water. Preserving mosques The Prophet [PBUH] stressed the importance of preserving articles belonging to mosques, no matter how small or of little use, warning against removing them from there. He said, \"A pebble implores the person who removes it from a mosque [to leave it in its place]\" [Abu Dawud]. At the time of the Prophet [PBUH] the mosque was carpeted with pebbles. The janitor or the person in charge of the mosque must be mindful of Allah and do his job faithfully. He must know that using anything belonging to mosque for other purposes is a major sin and a betrayal of trust. Allah the Majestic says: O you, who believe, do not betray Allah and the Messenger or betray your trusts while you know [the consequence]. [Qur`an 8:27] This act exposes mosques and their utilities to damage. Allah says in His holy Book: And who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of Allah from being mentioned in His mosques and strive toward their destruction. [Qur`an 2:114] Moreover, it wastes property of Muslims and the ministry of Religious Endowments which supervises endowments made by Muslims."

    "Question": "Our council has developed a device that saves tap water up to 50% in some cases. Typical to water in Greater Cairo, this percentage fluctuates according to changes in water pressure. The device called \"Wafer\", consists of two plastic pieces containing supplementary parts that hinder strong water flow, turns it into a steady flow and, to a certain extent, clears impurities from it. This device is subsidized and the council endeavors to install it free of charge in places of ablution in mosques, schools, youth centers, clubs, administrations, ministries and government authorities.",
    "Answer": "In addition to its effective economical role, this project is considered among the valuable projects that help spread cultural values and moral awareness among people.Apart from being an important economic factor in water conservation, economy is a moral value in itself. Islam teaches its followers to disapprove of wastefulness per se. 'Abdullah Ibn 'Amr (may Allah be pleased be with him) narrated that the Prophet passed by Sa'd while he was performing ablution and said,\"What is this wastefulness?\"Sa'd asked, \"Is it possible to be wasteful during ablution?\"The Prophet replied, \"Yes, even if you are on the bank of a flowing river.\"[1]The Prophet also instructed Muslims on how to progress from consumption to productivity. Anas Ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that he said, \"If the Hour (Day of Judgment) comes while one of you is planting a seedling, he should carry on and plant it.\"[2]Furthermore, in Islam, extravagance is depicted as exceeding the limits and is attached to Allah's wrath. Allah Almighty says,Eat of the good things We have provided for your sustenance, but commit no excesses therein, lest My Wrath should justly descend on you: and those on whom descends My wrath do perish indeed. [Taha, 81]The Prophet is the best example in this respect. Safina, the Prophet's servant (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"One sa'[3] of water would suffice the Prophet to wash from janaba[4] and one mudd[5] would suffice him for ablution.\"[6]Allah Almighty says,Ye have indeed in the Messenger of Allah a beautiful pattern (of conduct) for any one whose hope is in Allah and the Final Day, and who engages much in the Praise of Allah. [Al-Ahzab, 21]We ask Allah Almighty to reward those working on the project abundantly, bless their work and make their efforts sincere for His sake. We further ask Allah to grant Muslims success in comprehending the injunctions of Islamic law and in executing them in a manner that pleases Him.

    "Question": "We have some Christian friends. Would it be permissible for us to send them Christmas greetings?",
    "Answer": "Islam is the religion of mercy, piety and maintaining relations. One of the most important obligations upon Muslims at present is to demonstrate the beauty of Islam and be its best representatives through their manners and actions.Islam does not command anyone to sever ties with family or friends, nor to hateful towards them. On the contrary, Islam commands Muslims to treat non-Muslim family members and friends with kindness and refined manners. There is a big difference between hating disbelief and hating people and treating them as enemies because they are non-Muslims.Since Islam enjoins munificence and the good spirit that spreads happiness, optimism, hope and affection, you are to treat your friends with good manners. Do not settle for a phone call to congratulate them but you may even share their happiness and celebrations provided they do not involve any religious rites or practices that contradict Islam.And God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "A Christian friend asked me: how come you say that Islam treated the people of dhimma in good manners whereas the Christians had suffered under the Muslims’ rulership as was mentioned by Bernard Louis. He mentioned that Christians were not allowed to build their churches or even restore them. They also had no right to file law suits in courts and thus were unable to defend themselves. Moreover, Christians were not permitted to raise their voices in conducting ritual service and were subjected to rape, robbery and massacres. The taxes that were paid by Christians were the double of what was prescribed on Muslims. So please clarify all these issues for me.",
    "Answer": "Linguistically the word (dhimma) in Arabic means safety and covenant so the people of dhimma are the people of covenant and the dhimmi is the one who is bounded with the covenant. This name was popular between non Muslims because they are guaranteed security and safety by the Muslims. Thus their lives, families and properties were totally secured and they paid jizyah which is a very small amount of money in exchange of their protection and for not being recruited in the Muslims’ army. The amount of jizyah was around four grams of gold and was prescribed on those who have high and moderate income but not on those who are poor.God Almighty ordered Muslims to treat the people of dhimma with good manners. He says in the Quran, “Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.” 60:8 Imam al Tabari commented on this verse by saying that when God said, “God did not forbid us from those who do not fight you”, this verse applies on people from all different religions and creeds as we are asked to be kind, gentle and fair in our dealings with them. God asked us to practice “birr” which is the highest level of goodness that is used in dealing with one’s parents. Imam Muslim reported through the narration of An Nawas ibn Sam’an al Ansary that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) explained the word “birr” to mean good manners.Imam al Qarafi listed the different forms of “birr” that Muslims are commanded to practice with the people of dhimma. He said that soft words should be used in addressing them to show mercy and kindness along with praying for their guidance. Muslims are also asked to preserve their reputation whenever someone tries to slander them as all this is part of perfection of ethics which was commanded by God and his Prophet.Also the Islamic Shari’ah obligated Muslims to be kind to their parents even if they were from the people of dhimma. God says, But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them but accompany them in [this] world with appropriate kindness and follow the way of those who turn back to Me [in repentance]. Then to Me will be your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do. 31:15Ibn Kathir in his Quranic exegesis explained that even if the non Muslim parents exerted their utmost efforts to convert their Muslim sons/daughters to their own religion, they should not follow them yet they are obliged to maintain goodness and excellence in dealing with them. Muhammad ibn al Hassan added that the Muslim son is obliged to spend on his non Muslim parents in response to God’s command of accompanying one’s parents with goodness and high ethics. He added that it is not part of goodness for someone to live lavishly whereas his non Muslim parents are starving to death. Same goes for one’s non Muslims’ grand parents, children and grand children.Another important sign of goodness and high manners is praying for guidance for them as the Prophet prayed for the guidance of the tribe of Daws and this incident was narrated by Abu Huraira when he said, “al Tufail ibn ‘Amr al Dawsi and his companions came over to the Prophet saying, “O Prophet of God, Daws fell into disbelief and refused the call to Islam so pray God for a calamity to befell them” so the Prophet replied “O God I implore you to guide Daws and bring them to us”. (Muslim)The Islamic Shari’ah emphatically warned against harming the people of dhimma. It was reported through Abu Hurairah that the Prophet said, “Whoever kills someone who is bounded with the covenant of God and his Prophet, will not smell the scent of heaven …” (Ibn Majah)If we traced the Islamic history, we would find numerous examples of practicing excellence and good manners with the people of dhimma. For example, the covenant which ‘Umar ibn al Khattab wrote for the people of dhimma and asked his caliphs to keep it intact. The covenant ensures the security of their lives, money, children, dignity and possessions along with defending them from internal and external aggression. During the reign of the Ummayyads, the people of dhimma were appointed in leading positions in the caliphate for example the Akhtal, a Chrisitan, was the leading poet in the Ummayad royal family and Sarjon ibn Mansour al Rumi was the writer of Mu’awiyyah ibn Abi Sufyan and Ibn Athal was his appointed doctor.A lot of Western writers who were honest readers of history such as William James Durant mentioned in his book “The Story of Civilization” that the people of Dihmma who consisted of Zoroastrians, Christians and Jews enjoyed a level of tolerance during the Ummayyad Caliphate which was hard to find in Christian lands at that time. They were free to practice their religious rituals and they kept their churches and temples intact. He added that the Jews in the lands of the Far East welcomed the advent of the Muslim Arabs who liberated them from the oppression of the former rulers and they enjoyed full freedom in practicing their religious rituals. Christians as well were free to celebrate their religious festivals publicly and the Christians pilgrims were flocking to visit the Christian monuments safely in Palestine. Also the persecuted Christians who suffered the brunt of religious sectarianism under the auspices of the Byzantine Empire and with the supervision of the patriarchs in UrShalim, Antakya, and Alexandria due to their theological differences with the Byzantine church, they now became free under the Muslims’ rulership.The British historian, Thomas Arnold, said in this regard, “we have not heard of any deliberate attempt to force non Muslims to embrace Islam or any organized persecution aiming at eradicating the Christian religion”. He continued saying that the victorious Arab Muslims treated Christians with great tolerance since the first Hijri century and this religious tolerance continued in the following centuries. Therefore we can judge that the Christian tribes which embraced Islam did so with a conviction that resulted from a free will and educated choice. The Christian Arabs who live in our time among Muslim communities are eye witnesses of this religious tolerance.Blasco Ibanez, a Spanish writer, wrote about the Islamic conquest in Andalusia emphasizing that Spain welcomed the advent of those men coming from the African continent and the villages surrendered willingly to the Muslims without resistance or animosity. Whenever the villagers see from a close distance the advent of Muslim knights, they would open up the gates of their village and welcome them with delight. It was a conquest of civilization and not a conquest of oppression. The builders of the Islamic civilization did not give up in any certain period of time on the value of freedom of conscience as it is the bedrock on which great nations are built. The Muslims accepted the existence of Christian churches and Jewish temples and were not eager to build mosques on the debris of people’s religious temples. Muslims rather guaranteed others the freedom of worship and built mosques right next to other religious establishment without holding any grudges or any desire to rule over them.Therefore what you have mentioned in your question has a lot of historical fallacies because the people of Dhimma along the Islamic history had full religious freedom to practice their rituals according to the Islamic system which obliges Muslims to accept others and to deal kindly with the people of the Book. It is utterly not true that they were deprived of practicing their rituals or file law suits in the court of law. It is important for the one who seeks the truth about this matter to read objective books and not hostile ones. Also there is a big difference between the Islamic teachings over a certain matter and between the random practices of some Muslims which Islam does not approve of and should not bear its brunt."

    "Question": "How would I explain to my American friend the following verses: “Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled.” 9:29 and “And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah . And if they cease - then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do.” 8:39",
    "Answer": "The meaning of the word “humbled” in this verse does not indicate humiliation or degradation. This understanding is supported by the renowned Islamic scholars who confirmed that such degrading meaning does not have any origin in the Prophet’s conduct or biography and was not reported in the life of any of the four rightly guided caliphs. This degrading understanding falls under the prohibited harm which Muslims are commanded to refrain from as was stated by the Hanafi scholar Ibn ‘Abedeen in his writings. The Jiziya (which is a national defense tax that is paid by non Muslims) was in exchange of the protection that is given by Muslims to the people of Dhimma (the non Muslims who reside in Muslim lands) to guarantee the safety of their lives, families and possessions. The contract of Dhimma according to jurists is a perpetual contract which guarantees for the people of Dhimma safety of their religious freedom and security in the Muslims’ land in which they reside in exchange of paying jizyah along with their acceptance of the laws of the land in which they reside regarding non religious matters.The contract of Dhimmah is not an Islamic invention but is rather a contract that was popular among people before the advent of Islam and when Islam came, it condoned its existence and conferred legality to such practice. Islam also added some terms which changed the one who guarantees security for the people of Dhimma from individuals to security granted by God and his Prophet i.e the security is granted by the Islamic country itself. Islam also granted for this contract an eternal feature which is not subjected to any annulment to guarantee the safety of the non Muslims from any forms of injustice or oppression posed on them by Muslim rulers. The Jizyah was not an integral binding component of this contract in all cases as it was waived by the Prophet’s companions and those who followed them when the non Muslim residents participated in defending their country as it equated jihad. Therefore, Suraqah ibn ‘Amr for example waived it from the Armenians in 22 H and so did Habib ibn Maslamah al Fihri when he waived the jizyah from the people of Antakya. The same case was repeated by the companions of Abu ‘Ubayida ibn al Jarrah with his approval and the approval of the Prophet’s companions when they waived the jizyyah from the people of a city which is located in the Turkish- Syrian borders and called “al Jarajemah”.The Islamic history attests as well that Muslims made reconciliation with the people of Nuba at the time of ‘Abdullah ibn Abi al Sarh which conditioned the exchange of gifts every year between the two parties. Muslims also made reconciliations with the people of Cyprus during the reign of Mu’awiyyah ibn Abi Sufyan on the condition of maintaining neutrality and mutual taxes paid by the visitors of one country to another. The fact is that non Muslims who reside in Muslim countries are considered as legal citizens for more than 100 years now and they are recruited in the military and contribute their share of defending their homelands and therefore are not eligible to pay jizyah according to the sound juristic opinion of renowned scholars. Thus the accurate understanding of the non Muslims from the juristic perspective is that they are citizens and not people of Dhimma.When it comes to the concept of jizyah, it was not meant to be paid by non Muslims as sort of punishment for not embracing Islam or a grace conferred on them for keeping their life intact. This fact was reiterated by Sir Thomas Arnold in his book “The Call to Islam” in which he states “This tax was not imposed on the Christians, as some would have us think, as a penalty for their refusal to accept the Muslim faith, but was paid by them in common with the other dhimmis or non-Muslim subjects of the states whose religion precluded them from serving in the army, in return for the protection secured for them by the arms of the Musalmans. When the people of Hirah contributed the sum agreed upon, they expressly mentioned that they paid thisJizyah on condition that 'the Muslims and their leader protect us from those who would oppress us, whether they be Muslims or others.' (Sir Thomas Arnold, Call To Islam, pp. 79-81)It was also reported that Khaled ibn al Walid stated in the contract which he made with some cities near Hira “if we managed to protect you, then we get the jizyah and if we couldn’t we don’t get it”. When Muslims failed to meet the condition of protection of the people of the Dhimma, they returned back the paid jizyah to them and this happened during the reign of ‘Umar ibn al Khattab when he was informed that Heraclius was preparing a huge army to fight against the Muslims. Due to such circumstances, Abu ‘Ubaida, the Muslim military leader at the time, wrote correspondents to all the Muslim rulers of the cities that were opened by Muslims in the Levant area and commanded them to return back the jizyah money that was collected from these cities and he wrote to people of Dhimma saying, “we have returned back your money because we were informed of that a huge army was mobilized by the Romans and you placed a condition on us to protect you and we are unable to do it. So we have paid back your money to keep the condition intact along with the contract that was written between us and you and the contract will resume to be effective should we be granted victory”.Therefore, huge amount of money from the Islamic state was given back to Christians who prayed for Muslims to come out of the battle victorious and said “May God return you back victoriously to us and make you win over the Romans because if it were them in your place, they wouldn’t have returned anything to us and they would have taken everything left for us”. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said in this regard “whoever hurts a Dhimmi, hurts me”. Hurting in this context is more general than psychological or physical hurt and the Islamic Shari’ah asked Muslims to maintain fine manners with the people of the book who did not fight against Muslims nor assaulted them. God says, “Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.” 60:8And also said, “And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, \"We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.\" 29:46More importantly God Almighty asked Muslims to forgive the people of the Book who want Muslims to relinquish their faith and return back to disbelief. God says in the Quran, “Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves [even] after the truth has become clear to them. So pardon and overlook until Allah delivers His command. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.” 2:109These were only some of many verses which command Muslims to deal with non Muslims with fine manners, kindness and good ethics.Regarding the first verse which was mentioned in your question, it was revealed after the battle of Motah and addressed the Romans who mobilized their armies in an attempt to vanquish the Muslims’ state after a previous failing attempt conducted by the polytheists. Therefore, this verse was addressing those who do not keep their covenant or fulfill their vows and the terms “humbleness” that is mentioned in the verse refers to the actual act of giving jizyah after being subjugated to the Muslim state and its general system in exchange of safety, security and protection. This means that the word “humbleness” does not indicate taking the money from them in a humiliating way as this false interpretation goes against the sound understanding of the Quran and the Prophetic traditions regarding the fine treatment of the people of the book and the people of Dhimma in general.As for the second verse you mentioned in your question, it addressed the polytheists who mobilized their armies, collected their money and recruited their men to assault Muslim in the battle of Uhud and therefore the verse was revealed to motivate the Muslims to fight back the aggression and persecution. This means that the verse talks about the polytheist aggressors who prepared their troops to vanquish Muslims. Therefore this verse was not addressing non Muslims in general as the original state between Muslims and non Muslims is based on coexistence, good neighborhood, and kindness"

    "Question": "To what extent Muslims are allowed to integrate in Western countries? What are the types of customs and traditions which Muslims can tolerate in non Muslim countries such as hijab for women and circumcision for men?",
    "Answer": "The original state of the relationship between Muslims and non Muslims is based on integration and coexistence. God says in the Quran, “O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.” 49:13Therefore the reason for making people different is to get to know one another so this differentiation and variety which are divinely ordained is a tight universal system to bring and bond people together without hardship.God says in the Quran, “Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly Allah only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion - [forbids] that you make allies of them. And whoever makes allies of them, then it is those who are the wrongdoers.” 60:8-9Therefore God pointed out in the Quran that both justice and righteousness are the essential bases for dealing with those who did not fight against us and did not force us out of our houses. The Arabic linguistic meaning of “Bir” or righteousness encompasses all kinds of goodness. The Islamic Shari’ah also taught us how to deal with the people of the book on the basis of having a common principle, God says in the Quran, “Say, \"O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah .\" But if they turn away, then say, \"Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].\" 3:64In a direct application of the previous verse, God says in another verse, “This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage are] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.” 5:5Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in the last sermon which he gave during performing his farewell pilgrimage which was narrated by Jaber ibn ‘Abdullah, the Prophet said, “O people your lord is one and your father is one, there is no virtue of an Arab over a non Arab or vice versa and there is no virtue of a black man over a red one or vice versa except by piety” (al Baihaqi). It was reported through al Tirmidhi that Abu Hurairah narrated that Prophet Muhammad said, “God has casted away the arrogance and conceit of the pre Islamic period….you are from Adam and Adam is from dust”. Therefore Muslims are required to be the embodiment of mercy, fine manners and coexistence with those he lives with Muslims and non Muslims alike. For example with non Muslims, the Muslim is asked to exchange gifts with them and greet them with welcome and respect and with a warm smile. This good behavior is called good advocacy to Islam which God asked Prophet Muhammad to do. God says in the Quran, “Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided.” 16:125It is worthy to be noted that this kind of integration should not undermine the preservation of the Islamic identity through abandoning what God has ordained obligatory or permitting what God has deemed prohibited under the guise of integration. This kind of act is not integration but rather assimilation and dissolving. If a Muslim found it necessary under compelling reasons to abandon an obligation or commit a prohibited act, in this regard we have to differentiate between two spheres. The first sphere has to do with definitive rulings and the second one has to do with speculative rulings. Definitive rulings have to do with issues which reached Muslims’ consensus; a fact which leaves no room for ijtiahd or independent legal reasoning such as the obligation of praying five times a day, paying zakat, fasting the month of Ramadan, the prohibition of fornication, usury, injustice and major sins. These rulings are constant and are not subjected to any kind of change or alteration and therefore a person should not contradict these rulings by doing its opposite unless in times and cases of urgencies and needs.The second sphere has to do with the rulings that its evidence is speculative in terms of its chain of narration or its meaning and indication is not definitive and the examples are numerous on the speculative rulings. These rulings form the realm in which juristic scholars differ and therefore whoever encounters an issue which has a speculative ruling, he should imitate the scholars which permitted the act to facilitate his life and it is totally permissible for him to do so.As for the issue of hijab, it is obligatory on adult Muslim women and the woman is not permitted to take off her hijab unless she fears harm on herself or her family. As for circumcision, the father is permitted to circumcise his male children. Muslim jurists have two opinions regarding male circumcision. The first opinion which is adopted by the Shafi’is and Hanbalis deem it obligatory and the second opinion which is adopted by the Hanafis and Malikis deem it an approved act and the one who abandons it is not blameworthy.As for female circumcision, the current issued fatwa deems it impermissible due to its harm which was proven through scientific researches and medical conferences. One of the major legal maxims in Shari’ah is that no harm should be inflicted or caused. Also it was not reported that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) had circumcised his daughters but as for his two grand sons, Al Hassan and al Husayn, it was reported that they both were circumcised."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5988/what-is-the-islamic-stance-on-democracy-in-terms-of-its-definition-and-practice",
    "Question": "What is the Islamic stance on democracy in terms of its definition and practice?",
    "Answer": "Democracy as a term originally stems from two Greek words “demos” meaning “the people” and “kratein” meaning “to rule”. The two words indicate authority or rulership and it is defined as the rule of people by the people for the people.The Western understanding of this term places highly the authority of the people to an extent of giving people the full right of legislation and this full authority is higher in weight than any other authority. Therefore the executive authority executes the general laws or more precisely the general public’s will and the judicial branch rules with the laws which were legislated through the legislative authorities. In other words, whenever consensus of the people was reached on any issue, it passes as an effective law even if what was agreed on is considered prohibited in all religions and creeds.This Western understanding of democracy does not acquiesce with God’s Shari’ah in which the ruling solely belongs to God. God says in the Quran, “The decision is only for Allah . He relates the truth, and He is the best of deciders.\" 6:57 the renowned scholar Abu al So’ud commented on this verse in his exegesis saying that the ruling on all matters solely belongs to God without the slightest interference of anyone else in any way, shape or form. (3/142).Therefore people’s authority in Islam has a religious tie which means that the selected individuals which present the general public in making legislations are bound with the boundaries of the Shari’ah and are not authorized to go beyond it. In other words, every law that passes which in spirit contradicts the Shari’ah is deemed invalid. This understanding differs totally from the Western theocratic system which considers God as the ultimate supreme political authority and that the divine laws represent the civil laws which should be applied literally. Also they consider the religious clerics as the optimum religious experts who are the most qualified to understand God’s divine laws and thus they are the true representatives of God’s authority which should be manifested on earth through them.The difference between the two systems is that in Islam there is no sole entity which is seen as the ultimate religious authority that speaks in God’s name. But if by democracy we mean to establish some political and social principles like consultation, separation between legislative, executive and judicial powers, deliberation of authority, achieving justice, guaranteeing the right of life, work and freedom then with no doubt Islam calls for establishing such principles and activating them in the public life. These principles find its origin in the Quran whether explicitly or implicitly. God says in the Quran, “…and consult them in the matter… “3:195 and says, “…whose affair is [determined by] consultation among themselves…”42:38.The fact of the matter is that democracy has different models which suit the nature of the countries in which they are applied. Muslims are encouraged to take any democratic model established in any country as long as this democratic model does not go against the major Islamic tenets and principles."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5995/why-there-are-four-different-legal-schools-of-jurisprudence-can’t-we-agree-on-on",
    "Question": "If following a certain legal school of jurisprudence is not mandatory then what is the divine wisdom behind having four different legal schools of jurisprudence with so many various juristic opinions? Why the scholars do not agree on one juristic opinion and base their opinions only on definite authentic legal evidence?",
    "Answer": "The issues of the Islamic Shari’ah are divided into two categories. The first category has to do with issues that reached the Muslims’ consensus such as the number of the obligatory prayers, specifying the month of fasting, destination of prayer, location of pilgrimage, prohibition of intoxicants, adultery and usury and other matters which formulate the Islamic identity. These matters are not subjected to dispute as the legal evidences of these matters were definite.The second category has to do with issues which the scholars differed about. The reason for their different opinion is related to the fact that God made the supporting legal evidences for these issues speculative and not definite which means that the evidence bears the possibility of multiple ways of understanding it. The Islamic Shari’ah could have been formed of only the first category which refers to matters of consensus with no disputes among scholars. But the fact is that God decided for this religion to be the final divine word from heaven to earth and it is last testament from God to the whole creation. Therefore, the second category was solid evidence and an eye witness to testify to the flexibility of the Islamic Shari’ah and its applicability in different times, various geographical locations, all circumstances and diverse people.Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) conferred the validity of differences in understanding the possible legal evidence when he said to his companions, “no one among you prays the afternoon prayer till you reach the tribe of Banu Qurayza”. Some of the Prophet’s companions abided by the literal understanding of the Prophet’s words and refused to pray the afternoon prayer until they reached the tribe of Banu Qurayza which was after the sunset prayer. Other companions understood the embedded meanings behind the Prophet’s words which was some sort of encouragement and stimulation not to be late in arriving in Banu Qurayza so they prayed the afternoon prayer on their way to Banu Qurayza before the sunset prayer is due in accordance with following the spirit of the text and not it is literal meaning. These two different opinions resemble the two different intrinsic natures of human beings; abiding by the literal meaning of the text and between embracing the spirit of the text.The Prophet did not deny the opinion of any of the two parties which indicates the legality and permissibility of differences in understanding and opinions as this kind of differences falls under variation and not contradiction. Therefore it was said “Differences among my Ummah is a mercy” and if the legal evidences on these matters were definite, there would be no room for scholarly debate. It was according to God’s divine wisdom that the legal evidences on these matters were speculative and probable to make it easier on people so this is one of the beauties of religion.Confrontations and disputes only occurred among some Muslims who did not understand these prominent meanings of the concept of “difference” in the philosophy of the Islamic Shari’ah. They unfortunately dealt with speculative issues with the mindset of one exclusive opinion that does not bear the possibility of change or alteration and at the same time they deem their opponents as wrong or innovator in religion and this attitude is prohibited and not allowed"

This deal will generate huge profits for me and most of my partners consent to it. Is it permissible to print this book?",
    "Answer": "It is not permissible for the inquirer or any other person to reproduce a copyrighted book commercially. This is because reproducing the book without the copyright holder's permission, whether it is the author or publisher, is considered infringing upon another's right and theft.

    "Question": "Every community has its inherited customs and traditions that have endured across successive generations. However, due to cultural and conceptual changes, these customs and traditions have changed for the better except in our community (the tribes of Awlad Ali). The tribes in our community still hold on to both their good and bad customs.It is known that every tribe is divided into families. If, for instance, a member of one family steals or commits an immoral act, his entire family is punished for the crime. In the case of murder (such as when a person from one family kills another from a different family and tribe) a punishment called 'Nizala' [settlement], is imposed. It consists of having the offender's family settle with a different tribe for one year. This is considered injustice and oppression for the offender's family who leave their homes and interests—commercial, agricultural etc...Please clarify the legal ruling prescribed by Allah Almighty and commanded by His Messenger [pbuh] which states that only the offender is to be punished and not his whole family.",
    "Answer": "Such procedures for claiming and gaining rights are prohibited in Islamic law; rather, they are considered major sins. Punishing people for crimes committed by others is corruption on earth and considered judgments based on capriciousness and injustice. It is established in the principles of Islamic law that a person is not to be punished for another's crime and that it is impermissible to blame a person for a sin he did not commit. Allah the Almighty says, Nor can a bearer of burdens bear another's burdens if one heavily laden should call another to (bear) his load. Not the least portion of it can be carried (by the other). Even though he be nearly related. [Fatir: 18]and, And if any one earns sin. He earns it against His own soul: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. But if any one earns a fault or a sin and throws it on to one that is innocent, He carries (on himself) (Both) a falsehood and a flagrant sin. [An-Nisaa`: 111-112]Islamic law forbids banishing people from their homes unjustly and regarded this act an aggression deserving of punishment. Allah Almighty says, After this it is ye, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and banish a party of you from their homes; assist (Their enemies) against them, in guilt and rancor. [Al-Baqarah: 85]The Prophethighly honored the sanctity of Muslims. Once when he was looking at the Ka'ba, he said, \"How great you are and how great your sanctity! By Him in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad! The sanctity of a believer is far greater in Allah's sight than yours.\"[1] Therefore, we call upon every rational and honest person from this tribe and others to endeavor to repudiate this evil custom in which a person bears the burden of another. We call upon them to stand united as one against whoever lets himself be seduced into frightening those living in security, punishing the innocent for their relatives' or acquaintances' crimes or transgressing the limits in claiming and obtaining rights.Everyone must abide by the rulings of Islamic and public laws regulating rights. The purpose is to avoid complete chaos that gives oppression the upper hand and turns communities into a jungle where rights, principles and values are lost.Allah the Almighty knows best.[1] Narrated by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar [may Allah be pleased with them both]."

    "Question": "The inquirer owns a telemarketing company and has questions regarding the following:1. A team of employees deliver orders and perform services in the clients' homes and afterwards collects the fees. The company became aware that some of these employees deceive the customers into paying higher fees by falsely claiming higher prices and unsuspecting and trusting customers comply. The employees then give the [real] purchase price to the company and distribute the rest among themselves without reporting the extra money, claiming to give the company its due right. Is this permissible in Islamic law?",
    "Answer": "1-If the case is as mentioned in the question, the conduct of these employees is unlawful because it involves:• Lying to customers and wrongfully consuming their money.• Defaming and causing competitive harm to the company.• Causing conflict between customers and the company.• Cheating their employer.An employee is an agent hired by the company and not a broker. Therefore, he is not entitled to profit from the tasks for which he is paid. Moreover, it is established in Islamic law that it is impermissible for an agent to manage the business entrusted to him in a certain manner without the permission of his authorizer.2- Time plays a vital role in some jobs and employees have to carry out the tasks assigned to them during a specified number of hours. Based on this, the company provides its employees with costly means of transportation, allowing them to carry out the greatest number of assigned tasks, saving both time and effort which may be wasted by using cheaper means of transportation. Therefore, it is impermissible to save from the allocated travel expenses by using cheaper means of transportation except with the employer's permission.Some jobs require an employee to complete a certain task within a specific period. Once he completes his task within the appointed time nothing more is required of him; there is no harm if he uses public transportation and keeps the rest of the travel expenses provided he does not neglect his duties during their scheduled time. This is permissible unless it is otherwise mentioned in the contract due to the hadith which states \"Muslims must fulfill their agreements.\"Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling of keeping a dog in the house?",
    "Answer": "The majority of jurists have agreed that it is not permissible to keep a dog except out of need (hajah) like hunting, guarding, and other kinds of benefit that the law has not prohibited. The Malikis said that it is disliked to keep a dog for purposes other than agriculture, herding, or hunting, but some of them said that it is permissible (i.e. not disliked).This is based on the saying of the Prophet, “The reward of a person who keeps a dog for reasons other than herding, hunting, or agriculture is decreased every day by a qirat.” According to Ibn ‘Umar the Prophet said, “The reward of a person who keeps a dog for reasons other than hunting or herding is decreased every day by two qirats.” They said it is permissible to train puppies that are expected to learn for this purpose.Imam al-Nawawi said, “Al-Shafi’i and his companions said, ‘It is permissible to keep a dog for hunting, agriculture, or herding without disagreement based on what is mentioned by the al-Musanif. There are two positions mentioned by al-Musanif along with their evidence concerning keeping them to protect homes and neighborhoods and the most correct (asah) one is permissibility as is stated in the al-Mukhtasir.” Sheikh ‘Ilish, one of the great muhaqiqun of the Malikis said, “It is permissible to keep dogs for all beneficial purposes, and to ward off harm, even if it is not in the wilderness where thieves are feared.” Based on this, it is permissible to keep dogs for beneficial purposes or out of need, and it is impermissible otherwise.

    "Question": "What is the ruling on TV photos and Camera pictures?",
    "Answer": "The word picture or soorah in the Arabic language is equivalent to statue and the art of photography or tasweer in Arabic is equivalent to sculpture. This linguistic meaning was the one which Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) referred to regarding the art of sculpture. As for using the same word and applying it to the pictures taken by camera, it would not indicate a real usage of the word in its original meaning but rather a figurative use. Figurative usage of words does not change its actual meaning. For example artificial silk is not part of the prohibited silk for men which is clearly stated in prophetic traditions because what goes under prohibition is natural silk. Same goes for alcohol which does not become lawful for Muslims just because some people alter its name to spiritual beverages as this alteration does not change the meaning and reason for prohibition.Therefore, the craftsman who makes sculptures for the purpose of assimilating his works of art to that of God’s creation is the one who is admonished in the hadith. As for the photographer who captures the beauty of God’s nature through the lens of his camera is not included in admonishment at all."

    "Answer": "A widow's mourning period Allah the Almighty legislated that a widow must mourn her husband as an expression of loyalty and in recognition of his right upon her. Due to the significance of the marriage bond, a widowed wife may not adorn herself, wear perfume and colorful clothes or leave the marital house after her husband's death.In the early days of Islam, the wife mourned her husband for an entire year as a sign of sorrow and grief over his death. Allah the Almighty then reduced this period to four months and ten days.He says:And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind—they, [the wives, shall] wait four months and ten [days]. And when they have fulfilled their term, then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable manner. And Allah is [fully] acquainted with what you do [Al-Baqarah, 234].In a hadith narrated by Um Habiba, the prophet [pbuh] said: \"It is unlawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn anyone beyond three days except her husband for whom she is to mourn four months and ten days\" [Bukhari].According to the above hadith, it is not permissible for anyone other than the wife to mourn the deceased beyond three days.Condolences GatheringsIt is impermissible to hold ceremonies commemorating the 40th and annual anniversaries of the death of an individual that do not differ from the ceremonies held on the day of the death of the deceased. These ceremonies are usually announced in newspapers; pavilions are erected for the occasion to receive those who wish to offer their condolences. Similar condolences gatherings are held for women during the day, during which they wail, renew sorrow and offer their condolences once again.The prohibition for such gatherings is based on the fact that they renew sorrow and because the bereaved are put to unnecessary expenses which they may not be able to afford. There is a scholarly consensus that the mourning period is three days and that it is disliked to offer condolences beyond that time. They based their opinion on the above hadith narrated by Um Habiba, may Allah be pleased with her.Reciting the Qur`anIt is both lawful and recommended to recite the Qura`n and donate its reward to the deceased. Al-Sheikh al-Othmani mentions the consensus of the scholars in his book Rahmat Al-Umma fi Ikhtilaf al-A`ima: \"Scholars unanimously agree that such acts as seeking forgiveness, making supplications, giving alms, making pilgrimage and freeing slaves benefit the deceased and their rewards reach them. [Likewise], reciting the Qur`an by their graveside is recommended.\"Based on this, scholars maintain the permissibility of making pilgrimage on behalf of the deceased and donating its reward to them. This is because pilgrimage includes prayers during which the Fatiha and other chapters are recited and what reaches [the deceased] in whole reaches them in part. Therefore, the reward for reciting the Qura`n reaches the deceased by the will of Allah, especially if the recitor supplicates Allah to reward the deceased similarly. This must not be a matter of dispute.Allah the Majestic knows best."

    "Question": "Is it permissible for non-Muslims to volunteer to provide for Muslim children, build mosques, and establish charity projects such as hospitals, educational institutions, and other similar avenues of social welfare?",
    "Answer": "The principle of coexistence between Muslims and non-Muslims is derived from the Qur`anic verse:Allah does not forbid you to deal kindly and justly with anyone who has not fought you for your faith or driven you out of your homes: Allah loves the just [60:8]This verse refers to all kinds of human relations which include [social] support, co-operation, and interchange both on the individual and group levels.The prophet accepted gifts from non-Muslims• Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The ruler of Persia sent the messenger of Allah a gift and he accepted it; Caesar sent him a gift and he accepted it; kings sent him gifts and he accepted them\" [Ahmed and al-Tirmidhi. Al-Tirmidhi graded it fair].• Anas ibn Malek, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Ukaydar Duwmat gave the Messenger of Allah [P.B.U.H] a cloak made of fine silk\" [Muslim and Bukhari]. He also said: \"Malek Dhi-Yazin presented the Messenger of Allah [P.B.U.H] with a suit worth thirty three camels or she-camels and he accepted it\" [Abu Dawud].• 'Amr ibn 'Abdallah ibn al-Zubayr said: \"Futayla, went to her daughter Asama` bint Abu Bakr with gifts. Asma` refused to accept or even take the gifts into the house because her mother was a polytheist. Asma`'s sister, 'Aisha, asked the prophet [P.B.U.H] about this, so Allah revealed the verse:Allah does not forbid you to deal kindly and justly with anyone who has not fought you for your faith or driven you out of your homes: Allah loves the just [60:8].Then, the prophet [P.B.U.H] ordered Asmaa` to accept the gifts and take them into her house\" [Ahmed].• The prophet [P.B.U.H] accepted a gift from Salman al-Farsi (may Allah be pleased with him) before he became a Muslim. The hadith scholar, al-'Iraqi, mentioned in Tarh Al-Tathrib: \"This demonstrates [the permissibility of] accepting a gift from a non-Muslim. Salman was not a Muslim at that time—he [only] embraced Islam after recognizing the three signs of prophethood of which he had previously known.\"Position of the different schools of JurisprudenceIt makes no difference whether the donations made by non-Muslims benefit the religious or worldly interests of Muslims:• The Shafi'i scholars maintain this position by permitting endowments established by non-Muslims for the benefit of both the religious and worldly interests of Muslims. They base this on the condition that the endowment be an act of worship in itself regardless of the faith of the person making it.• The Malikis stipulate that the endowment established by a non-Muslim must be intended for worldly benefits only.• The Hanafis stipulate that the endowments must be regarded as acts of worship by both Muslims and non-Muslims living under Muslim rule.Position of some scholars- Al-Dusuqi, the Maliki scholar, stated that endowments are invalid in the following cases:• When they are established by non-Muslims at war with Muslims.• When the beneficiaries are mosques or charity projects for religious and worldly benefits. • When they include building mosques.According to him, endowments are valid when used for worldly pious acts such as building aqueducts and digging streams [Dusuqi's commentary on Al-Sharh Al-Kabir (4/122)].Ibn Najayim, the Hanafi scholar, said that the apparent meaning of Imam abu Hanifa's statement, only concerns non-Muslims living under Muslim rule. The purpose is to eliminate endowments that are regarded as a pious act by Muslims alone, such as endowments towards pilgrimage, mosques, and endowments regarded as acts of worship only by non-Muslims such as endowments for churches. These are different from endowments established towards the Sacred Mosque in Jerusalem which is regarded as a pious act by Muslims and non-Muslims alike [al-Bahr al-Ra`iq Sharh Kinz Daqa`iq (5/204)].• Al-Khatib Al-Shirbini, the Shafi'i scholar, said: \"The condition for an endowment is the validity of the statement [meaning his ability to articulate his intention- meeting the requirements for endowments] that affects it. This includes endowments established by non-Muslims. Endowments are valid when they are made by non-Muslims where the beneficiary is a mosque. The reason is that we consider it an act of worship even though they do not [Mughni al-Muhtaj 2/510].“The meaning intended by the verse:It is not right for the idolaters to tend God's places of worship while testifying to their own disbelief [9:17]"

    "Question": "What is the Islamic ruling on photography and drawing humans?",
    "Answer": "Scholarly opinion on drawing humans Drawing humans is permissible according to some scholars; Maliki scholars, some of the predecessors [Salaf] and the Hanbali scholar, Ibn Hamdan, have likewise maintained this opinion. They based their opinion on the fact that the prohibition is restricted to complete statues which imitate Allah's creation. In his Musanaf, Ibn Abu Shaybah reported this opinion from the venerated tabi'i [a person who was born after the Prophet's death and who accompanied some of his Companions] Al-Qasim Ibn Mohammed, may Allah have mercy on him, who was known as the best scholar of his time. The hadith reads: Ibn 'Awn said, \"I entered upon Al-Qasim in his house which was located in the upper part of Mecca and saw a hajla [a net placed over a bed as a protection against flying insects] with the images of a phoenix and a beaver.\" In Fath Al-Bari, Ibn Hajar declared the chain of transmission of this hadith authentic. In his commentary on Sahih Muslim [Sharh Muslim], Al-Nawawi said: \"Some of the Salaf have maintained that complete statues [figures which cast a shadow] are prohibited; otherwise, they are unrestrictedly permissible — and he went further saying that the unrestricted permissibility of non casting shadows photos is an invalid opinion. Ibn Hajar, however, said in Fath Al-Bari that the invalidity of this opinion is disputable.\" RulingBased on this, this matter is from among the controversial issues and there is no objection to following any of the opinions stated by scholars in this regard. This is because disagreement brings ease. Therefore, there is no objection to drawing animates such as humans, animals and the like, whether from imagination, nature or photographs. There is no objection in Islamic law to pursuing this talent provided the drawings are void of anything prohibited and do not incite sexual desires. Likewise, it is impermissible to paint or photograph nudity or a 'awrah [part of the body that must be concealed] that religion, good morals, piety and man's sound natural disposition commands us to cover. May Allah guide you to that which pleases Him."

    "Question": "What is the legal ruling for resorting to the bihs'a?",
    "Answer": "There is no basis for trial by bish'a[1]in Islamic law. Rather, we must follow the words of the Messenger of Allah who said,\"The claimant must offer evidence [for his claims] and the defendant must swear [to his innocence]\" [recorded by Ad-Darqutni]. This noble hadith sets the manner of seeking and establishing truth and denying false claims. Muslims must adhere to this injunction and reject any offensive practices which have no basis in Islamic law. The only manner prescribed by Islamic law for verifying claims of usurped rights are confessions, proof and the like.Allah Almighty knows best.[1]Trial by bish'a involves the suspect licking a red hot iron.

The procedure is performed either for aesthetic enhancement of breasts, to augment breast size or for a necessary medical purpose i.e. breast reconstruction after mastectomy to treat breast cancer. Please note, approximately 70% of the procedures are performed for aesthetic purposes. Is selling and marketing these products lawful?",
    "Answer": "Trading in these products is permissible and takes the same ruling as other commodities that can be used for either lawful or prohibited purposes. Consequently, it is permissible to sell them as it is likewise permissible to make contractual agreements for these products. This is because they are not explicitly used for unlawful purposes, the contractual agreement is for a lawful product, the integrals and conditions of the contract are met, the seller does not use them for unlawful purposes and he is not certain they will be used for such purposes.

    "Question": "What is the ruling on wearing shoes made of swine skin?",
    "Answer": "It is established in Islamic law that it is prohibited to consume pork. Allah the Almighty says,He hath only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that on which any other name hath been invoked besides that of Allah. [Al-Baqarah: 173]Just as Islamic law forbids consuming the flesh of swine, it likewise forbids selling swine or benefitting from it. Jabir Ibn Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with them) narrated that he heard the Messenger of Allah say, \"Verily Allah and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead animals, swine and idols.\" He was asked, \"O Messenger of Allah! What about the fat of dead animals? It is used for coating boats, varnishing hides and [as fuel] for lamps.\" The Messenger of Allah said, \"No, it is forbidden.\" He then said, \"May Allah the Exalted and Majestic destroy the Jews for Allah prohibited the use the fat of dead animals; they melted it, sold it and made use of the price [received from it].[1]Ibn 'Abbas said, \"I saw the Messenger of Allah sitting at the Rukn. He looked up at the sky, smiled and said, 'May Allah curse the Jews'—he repeated this thrice and then said, 'Allah made the fat [of dead animals] prohibited upon them, yet they sold it and consumed its price. And when Allah prohibits a community from eating something, He prohibits them from utilizing its price.\"[2]The reason behind the prohibition of selling swine and benefitting from it according to the majority of scholars is because swine is impure in itself, whether dead or alive. Maliki scholars have maintained that swine is pure when alive and impure when dead.The ruling Based on the above and in reference to the question, it is impermissible to wear shoes made from swine skin because it contradicts the Prophet's ordinance of the prohibition of selling swine and benefitting from it.Allah the Almighty knows best.

    "Question": "I have a question about the ruling concerning the eating of meat which is not halal. For years I have heard conflicting things. Some claim that we could only eat Christian meat back in the times when they used to kill their meat religiously and others say that it is okay to eat it no matter what.",
    "Answer": "The basic principle is that it is prohibited to eat the meat of animals other than those made lawful by the Shari'ah [En. Islamic law] and which are slaughtered by either Muslims or the People of the Book. Therefore, the permissibility of eating the meat of animals slaughtered by the People of the Book cannot be removed by doubt.RulingThe principle is that it is permissible to eat from the meat of the people of the Book unless one is certain that the animal was slaughtered by a non-Christian or a non-Jew or that it was beaten to death or electrocuted. But if one is not certain, the permissibility prevails.- Evidence:A Jewess offered the Prophet [peace and blessing be upon him] [the meat of a cooked sheep]. He ate from it without asking the manner of its slaughter or whether God's name was mentioned over it.Based on the above:The principle in Shari'ah is to think well of people. Hence, when one is in a country where the majority of its people are from the People of the Book it is unlawful to be overly particular and delve into matters. God says in Surat al-Ma'idah:Oh you who believe! Do not ask about matters which, if made known to you, might make things difficult for you… [5:101].In his commentary on this verse, Ibn Katheer said: \"God Almighty instructs His believing servants and prohibits them from asking about matters which do not benefit them … the apparent meaning of this verse is to prohibit asking about matters which, if made clear, may create hardship for the inquirer so it is better to refrain from asking about them.\" Hence, it is disliked to delve into the heart of a matter. Haritha ibn al-Nu'man (may God be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Whenever ill thoughts creep into your mind, do not engage yourself in verifying them.\""

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5952/muslims-greeting-non-muslims-in-holidays-and-exchanging-gifts-is-it-permissible",
    "Question": "It is known that Islam has commanded humankind to be kind to one another. Is it permissible for a Muslim to give gifts to non-Muslims and to send them special greetings during their holidays?",
    "Answer": "Maintaining ties, giving gifts, visitation, and congratulating non-Muslims are from the acts of goodness. God has enjoined us to say good things to everyone without distinction. He has stated, “speak fair to the people” and “God commands justice and the doing of good.” Likewise God has not prohibited us from being good to non-Muslims, from visiting them, giving them gifts, and receiving gifts from them. God states, “God forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for (your) Faith nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them: for God loveth those who are just.” The Messenger of God implemented this in his personal life, as he was a walking Qur’an making its moral code his code. There are many hadith that demonstrate that the Messenger of God accepted gifts from non-Muslims. These hadith are also transmitted through diffuse congruence and are therefore of the highest authenticity. For example, “The Messenger of God sent Hatib ibn Abi Balt‘a to the Christian ruler of Alexandria with a message for him, and the Patriarch accepted the letter, honored Hatib, and made his stay comfortable. The Patriarch then sent him back with a garment for the Messenger of God, a mule with its saddle, and two slave girls as gifts. One slave girl was Um Ibrahim and the other one the Messenger of God gave as a gift to Jahm ibn Qays al-cAbdari.Another anecdote occurred during the time when Salman the Persian became Muslim. “Salman the Persian came to the Messenger of God when he first entered Madina and had with him a platter of dates. He placed this in the hands of the Messenger of God and the Messenger of God said to him ‘What is this Salman?’ He replied ‘charity for you and your companions’ The Messenger of God said ‘take it since we do not eat from charity.’ Salman took it and returned the next day with a similar platter and gave it to the Messenger of God who asked him ‘what is this Salman?’ and Salman replied ‘charity for you and your companions’ and the Messenger of God told him ‘take it since we do not eat from charity.’ So Salman took it and came the following day with a similar platter and gave it to the Messenger of God who said to him ‘what is this Salman?’ and he replied ‘a gift’ so the Messenger of God told his companions ‘come and have refreshments!’” The Hadith Master al-‘Iraqi commented on this hadith by saying that “this is proof that accepting gifts from non-Muslims is permissible since Salman was still not a Muslim at this point in time.” These texts demonstrate that receiving gifts from non-Muslims is permissible and is even considered a Prophetic practice. This accepting the gift is not only out of general kindness to humanity, but is also to follow the Sunna. Sheikh al-Islam Zakariyya al-Ansari mentions that, “it is permissible to accept a gift from a disbeliever as to follow the example of the Messenger of God.” This is further emphasized by the word of Imam al-Sarakhsi who said:It has been mentioned on the authority of Abi Marawan al-Khuza‘i who said “I told Mujhaid that there is a family relation between me and a certain person from the disbelievers and I owe him money, should I give it to him?” and Mujahid said “yes and you should keep family ties with him.” According to this we can deduce that there is nothing wrong with a Muslim maintaining family ties with non-Muslims whether they be family or otherwise. The Messenger of God also sent 500 dinars to Makkah during their famine and he ordered that this amount be given to Abu Sufyan ibn Harb and Safwan ibn Umaya to disperse the amount amongst the needy of Makka. The two accepted the money and said, “Muhammad only seeks to trick our youth.” Keeping family ties is a praised act according to every sound intellect and every religion, and giving gifts is from good acts as the Messenger of God said, “I was only sent to perfect moral character” so we have come to understand that this act is good as far as Muslims and non-Muslims are concerned. Ibn Muflih the great Hanbali jurist, after mentioning the verse, “God forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for (your) Faith nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them: for God loveth those who are just” that Ibn Jawzi said, “The exegetes have stated that this verse is a dispensation to maintain ties with those who are not in hostility with Muslims, a dispensation to be kind to them even if there is no relationship between them. Some have stated that this verse has been abrogated with the verse of the sword [i.e. to fight non-believers], however ibn Jarir says that there is no validity in this statement since Muslims treating those at war with them nicely, if these are family members or otherwise, is not prohibited as long as it does not aid the enemy in battle against the Muslims. He then mentioned the two hadith of Umar giving a silk garment to his polytheist brother and the hadith of Asma’, he then said that these are examples of maintaining family ties with those at war with Islam.” Al-Mardawi the Hanbalite has mentioned that concerning the issue of extending condolences to non-Muslims when necessary, or sending holiday greetings the sound opinion is that it is permissible. It is also mentioned in the Indian Fatwa Collection that, “There is nothing wrong with being guests to non-Muslims…and there is nothing wrong with having non-Muslims as guests even if the only thing between them is a simple acquaintance…there is nothing wrong with a Muslim maintaining ties with a non-Muslim be they a close relative or not, a person at war with Islam and Muslims or a dhimmi.”Based on the textual evidence as well as the opinions of the prominent jurists mentioned in this answer, we find that it is from goodness that a Muslim keep ties with non-Muslims during all conditions such as: sick visitations, sending condolences upon death, giving gifts, accepting gifts, and having guests over. Such actions are a way of showing people Islam by demonstrating good character and God is most high and all knowledgeable"

    "Question": "What is the legal ruling for adoption?",
    "Answer": "The reward of ParadiseIslam encourages sponsoring orphans, rearing them, treating them kindly and seeing to their needs and interests to the extent that the Prophet [peace and blessings be upon him] promised that the person who sponsors an orphan will enter Paradise alongside him. Evidence from the Sunnah\"The one who raises an orphan and I are like these [two] in Paradise (and he pointed to his middle and index fingers)\" [Bukhari]. \"An orphan's guardian, whether he is a relative or non-relative, and I are like these two in Paradise\" [Muslim].\"Whoever takes in the orphan of two Muslim parents and provides him with food and drink until he can support himself, will enter Paradise\" [Ahmed].\"The best of homes in the sight of Allah is that in which an orphan is well treated\" [reported by al-Tabarani from a raised-chain hadith narrated by ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both].\"The person who provides for a widow and a needy person is like one who strives for the sake of Allah, and I think he said, \"like the person who does not tire of praying and the person who frequently fasts\" [reported by Bukhari and Muslim from a narration of Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him].Adoption in IslamAdoption is taking in another's child as one's own. Islam prohibits adoption and deems all its consequences invalid as attested to by the words of Allah, \"… nor does He make your adopted sons into real sons. These are only words from your mouths, while God speaks the truth and guides people to the right path. Name your adopted sons after their real fathers; this is more equitable in God's eyes—if you do not know who their real fathers are [they are your] 'brothers-in-religion' and protégés.\" [Qur`an 33:4-5]Allah commanded that whoever sponsors an orphan child is not to attribute it to himself, but to its biological father if he is known; otherwise, the child should be called 'Mawla' or 'brother-in-religion'. In this way, Islam prevents people from changing truths and preserves the rights of heirs from loss or reduction, protects against mingling between the sexes, and being in the private company of a non-mahram [persons to whom marriage is legitimate] such as that between the male adoptee and the maharem [persons to whom marriage is illegitimate] of his adoptive father as well as between a female adoptee and her adoptive father, his sons and male relatives. Such mingling spreads corruption, the evils of which are only known to Allah Almighty who has knowledge of what He created—He is the Ever Kind and All Knowing.Ruling Based on this, the responsibility of sponsoring an orphan in Islam includes all the responsibilities and duties of adoption except changing lineage, which Islam prohibits, and its ensuing consequences.Allah the Almighty knows best."

Also, i wanted to tell them that our religions instruct us to give safety and security to non Muslims living in Islamic countries. so could you please elaborate on this issue?Thanks a lot and I am waiting for your reply",
    "Answer": "Defending Islam and its true concepts necessitates manifesting them in the correct way away from erroneous radical concepts. This, in fact, is the role of every Muslim who takes it upon himself to represent Islam either by word or deed. It is the duty of all Muslims to follow the true teachings of Islam when dealing with others to illustrate the religion's beauty, tolerance, sublimity and refinement. Likewise, Muslims must abide by good manners and the rights of citizenship and neighborliness. They must represent a role model in coexistence and communication with the other—i.e. sharing with them their good times, consoling them in their times of grief and not blaming those of other faiths for the irresponsible behavior committed by some individuals. This is because in Islam, no one bears the burden of another.Irresponsible reactions to insults made towards Islam demonstrate a complete ignorance of the faith, blind foolishness and attributing falsities to Islam which displeases Allah Exalted be Him and His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him). Not only this, such actions result in defaming Islam before non-Muslims; rather it may incur insults and doubt upon the religion.Allah Almighty warned Muslims against following this path as per His words:And do not insult those they invoke other than Allah, lest they insult Allah in enmity without knowledge. Thus We have made pleasing to every community their deeds. Then to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them about what they used to do. (Al-'An'am, 108).Islam has never been the sort of religion that calls for violence and terrorism toward such incidents. Rather, it urges its followers to abide by wisdom and good manners in their reactions to manifest its tolerant of nature. This way, all the evil plots of the corrupt will be unveiled and their cunning will be in vain.Muslims' irresponsible actions toward insults have nothing to do with the teachings of Islam. Rather, they are considered taking part in falsehoods, corruption and spreading extremist ideas which are mistakenly interpreted as Islam. This is nothing but taking part in turning people away from following the path of Allah and from the true essence of Islam."

    "Question": "A few years before his death, my father put a sum of money in a deposit account in my name. What is the ruling for this sum?",
    "Answer": "It is permissible for a person to dispose of his property in any legitimate manner and as he sees fit provided he enjoys full legal capacity (i.e. is an adult, sane, does not dispose of his property under duress, is not suspended from dealings nor suffering from death sickness). If he passes away after disposing of his property by one means or another, then his disposition—whether it is a gift, relinquishing ownership in favor of another, sale, or otherwise—is a legal and effective contract.The property is not included in the estate of the deceased but is the exclusive right of the person in whose name it is written. None of the heirs is to share it with him or ask for a share in it. Some of the prospective heirs may receive more than others for a legal cause such as:- A need;- An illness;- An affliction;- They have many children;- To secure the future of young ones;- As a recompense for dutifulness or extra love;- To aid in education or marriage expenses and so forth.It is not considered injustice to favor a child over another for a reason. It is due to the above mentioned reasons that some of the Companions favored some of their heirs over others. This was reported from Abu Bakr and 'A`isha (may Allah be pleased with them) and others. This also explains why the majority of scholars recommend and not obligate the equitable treatment of children concerning gifts.The rulingThe sum your father deposited in the bank in your name is exclusively yours.

    "Answer": "Issuing fatawa is an honorable and high ranking position, since the mufti fulfills some of the responsibilities of the Prophet in the community and acts on his behalf in delivering rulings. Imam Al-Nawawi said in al-Magmu‘: Take note that formulating legal opinions is the greatest of dangers, a grand position, and is full of merits. This is because a mufti is heir to the prophets, peace and blessings of Allah be upon them, and fulfills the communal obligation. However, he is subject to errors. Because of this, it is said that a mufti is the legal representative of Allah. (1:40)There is a huge difference between knowing one or several legal rulings by being well read on Islam and reporting it to others – this reporting to others is not called issuing a fatwa – and being a mufti who conveys the teachings of religion from Allah and instructs the masses on His intent, and knowing how the ruling of Allah applies appropriately to a situation in a manner which accomplishes the overall objectives of the Shari‘ah and which is consistent with the general interests of the people.

    "Question": "My mother made a bequest in which she directed that her land is to be divided up equally among her sons and daughters. Is this bequest permissible?",
    "Answer": "It is permissible to make a bequest to an heir or a non-heir in up to one third of the estate without the need to obtain the consent of the heirs. Additionally, it is permissible to bequeath more than one third of one's estate though the excess portion is not executable except after the heirs authorize it. The heirs must be adult, sane, not suspended from dealings, not coerced into consenting and knowledgeable of what they are authorizing.If some of the heirs authorize the portion in excess of one third and others do not, then this excess is executable only from the portion of the heirs who consent to it. This is the opinion implemented in Egyptian courts and for fatwa. The Egyptian law of inheritance, law no. 71 for the year 1946 CE implements this opinion which is likewise one of the opinions of Islamic law in the matter.It is not permissible to contest matters over which there is a difference of scholarly opinions. The legal principle states that the ruling laid down by authorities lifts manifest and concealed differences.Bequests are executed before estate division due to the words of Allah the Almighty Who says,(The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies and debts. [An-Nisaa`:11[The rulingBased on the above, your mother's bequest is permissible. The heirs do not need to authorize it if the bequeathed land is equal to one third of the estate or less. But as previously mentioned, it is necessary to obtain the consent of the heirs, each concerning his share, if the bequeathed land comprises more than one third of the estate.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "My only son passed away in the blessed month of Ramadan. I do not have a husband or anyone to support me. I would like the legal opinion for the following:1- Is it recommended for me to relinquish all or part of my legal share in my son's estate? Should such a relinquishment — whatever its percentage — be in favor of my son's wife or also in favor of my young grandchildren? What is the recommended percentage?2- Since I do not have any children to inherit me, is it possible for me to leave a will in favor of my three young grandchildren (2 girls and 1 boy) to be implemented after my death? What is the permissible percentage that I may leave of what I own?3- Apart from the will, is it possible for me at present to buy — without any limit to the amount — a property, shares or securities for my young grandchildren?",
    "Answer": "1- There is nothing in Islamic Law that exhorts grandparents to relinquish their share in a son's estate in favor of their grandchildren. However Islamic Law urges one to leave his heirs — especially if they are young, needy, or have special needs — prosperous and in no need of others. The Prophetsaid, \"To leave your heirs wealthy is better than to leave them in need and begging from others\" [Recorded by Bukhari and Muslim through Sa'd ibn Abu Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him)]. We advise you to relinquish your share in favor of those of your grandchildren who may want in the future.There is no prescribed percentage but the matter revolves around what you see is in the interest.2- You may bequeath one third of the estate to your grandchildren.3- Yes, you may do this."

    "Question": "A woman's husband passed away a few days before the consummation of their marriage. In this situation, what are the legal rulings for the following:",
    "Answer": "1- It is established in Islamic law that a wife whose husband passes away receives her full dowry.2- As for the compensation mentioned in the question, if it is not paid out to certain beneficiaries based on the damages they experience due to the death of the deceased, it is to be divided according to the rules of inheritance.3- The pension is to be distributed according to the insurance and pension law.4- The wife is to receive her deferred dowry before the division of the estate.5- If the apartment mentioned above was owned by the deceased, it is to be divided among the heirs each according to his share as follows:- the wife receives her obligatory share which is a quarter of its value- the father receives the rest as his obligatory share due to the absence of a closer universal heir. The siblings of the deceased, males and females, do not receive anything because they are eliminated by their father.This is the ruling for the above if the case is indeed as mentioned in the question and the deceased does not have any other heirs that have not been mentioned.Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling for the registry of furniture known as 'registry of marital effects'. It has been said that this is an innovation in religion with no basis in Islam and that the practice must be abandoned",
    "Answer": "Islamic law has established rights for women — financial, moral, and others. It granted her financial independence and prescribed for her a marriage dowry (which she is free to dispose of as she wishes) and inheritance. She is entitled to buy and sell, give and receive gifts, and engage in other forms of financial transactions. Allah Almighty says,And give the women (on marriage) their dower as an obligation; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it and enjoy it with right good cheer. [An-Nisaa`: 4] Also (prohibited are) women already married, except those whom your right hand possess: Thus hath Allah ordained (prohibitions) against you: Except for these, all others are lawful, provided ye seek (them in marriage) with gifts from your property, -- desiring chastity, not fornication. Give them their dowery for the enjoyment you have of them as a duty; but if, after a dower is prescribed, ye agree mutually (to vary it), there is no blame on you, and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise. [An-Nisaa`: 24]A woman whose marriage has been consummated is entitled to exclusive ownership of her household furnishings if she has furnished her marital house from the advanced portion of her dowry, whether she received it in the form of cash or furnishings. But if the marriage has not been consummated, she is [only] entitled to half of the household furnishings by virtue of the marriage contract as expressed in primary texts.Household furnishings are usually placed in the marital house which the husband either owns or rents and therefore, they are under the his control. Due to diminishing consciences and the increase in spousal rights violations, it was deemed necessary to institute [the concept of] an 'inventory of household effects' to guarantee a woman's rights in the event of marital discord. This has become a customary practice in the community.Customs are one of the sources of Islamic legislation provided they are consistent with the Qur`an, Sunnah, ijma' (scholarly consensus), and qiyas (analogy). This is because there is no room for ijtihad (independent interpretation) in the existence of a text and because of th words of the Prophet who said, \"What Muslims deem good, is good in the eyes of Allah and what Muslims deem offensive, is offensive in the eyes of Allah Almighty\" [Ahmed]. There is no objection to writing a registry of furniture since it not an offensive practice but rather a good one.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Christmas is around the corner and I do not know what to do about my non-Muslim mother. I do not want her to be alone on this occasion, as she does not have her family with her and she invited my brother and me over to spend this day with her. I know she wants our company. She respects our choice of religion and serves us only halal meat when we visit her for dinner. She even greets us on our Eids. My intention is not to celebrate Christmas, but to keep a bond with my mother and soften her heart towards. On the other hand, I have heard many opinions from Muslims deeming this to be prohibited and some even go as far as to say it is shirk. Kindly advise us.",
    "Answer": "Your earnest concern to being dutiful towards your mother and spending time with her during Christmas is admirable as is your eagerness to demonstrate an excellent example of Muslim manners. It is nonetheless appalling that some self-proclaimed scholars equate spending time with a non-Muslim parent or family during Christmas with shirk or polytheism! This opinion is an aberration of the true authentic teachings of Islam in both letter and spirit.Islam is a religion of mercy. The mercy of Islam is universal and includes all humans regardless of their religious affiliations, cultural differences and ethnic backgrounds. It even encompasses plants and animals.The Quran does not only allow Muslims to maintain ties with their non-Muslim families, but raises makes it obligatory. God Almighty says, \" But if they (your parents) endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them but accompany them in [this] world with appropriate kindness and follow the way of those who turn back to Me [in repentance]…” (Quran 31:15). In this noble verse, God commands us to keep warm ties with our families even when they exert their utmost to make us leave Islam. If this is so, a fortiori those who show respect to our religious choices and do not insult our belief in any way. We should be more eager to show them greater kindness and envelope them with mercy.Islam places paramount importance on the concept of high morals and even establishes a strong connection between them and faith. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, \"The nearest of you to me on the Day of Judgment are those who have the best morals.\" Muslims are therefore commanded to be kind to others and refrain from discriminating against them based on their religious choices, cultural backgrounds, or the like.There is no legal impediment to participating in celebrating the birth of Jesus (peace be upon him). Islam is an open system and its followers believe, respect, and honor all the prophets and messengers. They treat the followers of other religions with kindness in fulfillment of the words of God Almighty, “And dispute not with the People of the Book, except in the best way” (Quran 29: 46).Jesus, the son of Mary (peace be upon him) is one of the prophets who are characterized with determination and patience. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said, \"I am more entitled to Jesus the son of Mary than anyone in this life and in the Hereafter; no prophet has been sent between us.\" Every Muslim believes that Jesus is a human and a prophet who performed great miracles, by the will of God Almighty. This is not because he was a god or the son of God in the sense of physical procreation — God is exalted above this. Celebrating the day of the birth of Jesus is an act of belief regardless of Christian convictions in his regard. Therefore, there is no objection to participating with your parent/s, family, and friends on this joyful event. Eat with them but refrain from eating pork and drinking alcohol with tact and civility. Do not pay any attention to anyone who wants to ruin relations between you and your family and others in the name of Islam because Islam is innocent from all of this.And God Almighty knows best."

    "Id": 5922,
    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5922/can-i-use-perfumes-which-contain-alcohol",
    "Question": "Assalamu Alaikum,",
    "Answer": "The correct opinion that the Shaf'i school of jurisprudence and the other schools maintain is that alcohol is not filth in itself and it is permissible to be utilized in [manufacturing] perfumes, detergents, medicine and other useful usages. If one performs prayer while wearing perfume containing alcohol, his prayer is valid. This is because of the following reasons:1- It is established in Shari'ah [En. Islamic law] that objects are principally pure [Ar.tahir]. Although it is prohibited in Shari'ah to drink alcohol, it does not necessitate it to be filth [Ar. Najesa]. This is because ruling on alcohol to be filthy in Shari'ah would necessitate separate evidence. Narcotics/drugs and poisonous substances are prohibited, though they are pure, because there is no evidence on its filth. The legal standard state, \"Filth is attached to prohibition; prohibition does not necessitate objects to be filth. Any filthy object is prohibited and not otherwise\".2- The Shafi'is generally consider all liquid intoxicants of grabs as wine and stipulate for the filthiness of the liquid to have the property of causing strong state of intoxication. The Hanafis stipulate for the filthiness of the liquid to produce foam. The Shafi' also applied this to all liquid intoxicants other than grabs which also cause strong state of intoxication and they considered them prohibited and filthy. The Hanafis maintain that any liquid intoxicants other than grabs are not filth; though they have considered it prohibited to be taken.Based on this, alcohol is not considered as wine or filthy. It is not also a liquid intoxicant, unlike wine which scholars have differed over determining its filthy or pure properties. Alcohol is merely a toxicant substance and it is not meant to be drunk in normal conditions for the sake of intoxication. Rather, it is prohibited to take toxicant substances because it is harmful and destructive. Alcohol is pure the same as hashish and opium and all of them are harmful.3- Alcohol is not naturally drinkable. Although being a liquid, it is not necessary for alcohol to be filthy. According to the most valid opinion of the Shafi's that every intoxicant beverage is filthy. The Shafi'srefer to intoxicant beverage as any liquid that cause strong state of intoxication. They did not use the term liquid in order not to generalize the ruling and consider all liquid intoxicants as filth. Rather, it is conditioned for liquid intoxicants to be drinkable to consider them filthy.4- The principle is that intoxicant drinkable liquids are prohibited by the texts of Shari'ah. However, any other liquid which is not naturally drinkable such as alcohols is not prohibited by the texts unless there is separate evidence on this especially that it was not available during the time when the ruling was legislated. However, it is prohibited to be taken because of being harmful.5- Filth is governed by the laws of Shari'ah and it is not a chemical fact. This means that wine is considered filth in the Shari'ah, while the chemical analysis proved that alcohol is considered the intoxicant element in wine. This mere chemical fact does not necessitate alcohol to be filth or prohibited when it is found in liquids other than wine. This is because it is not necessary for the generated elements of a filthy compound to be impure. There is a consensus that filth includes urine and excrement which are made up of chemical elements that can be found in pure things; rather in food and drink. However, filthiness and impurities attached to them as an outcome of the presence of certain filthy compounds. Fermentation only occurs when the object contains a sugary substance, or the fermentation can never be occurred such as the case with colocynth. Fermentation is the conversion of the sugary substance to carbonic acid and alcohol. Consequently, the liquid becomes intoxicant because of the presence of alcohol. Alcohol in itself is not intoxicant, however it is harmful. If someone merely drinks alcohol, he would either fall asleep or be unconscious. In order to transform alcohol to intoxicant liquid, we should mix one part of alcohol with three parts of water and distill the whole amount and it will produce wine. Mixing alcohol with water turns it to intoxicant liquid. The variety of intoxicant liquids result from the different sugar degrees formed when mixing alcohol with much or little amount of water. 'Arrack contains 40% or more of alcohol, the remaining kinds of wine contain 10% of alcohol, beer which is made from barely contains 5% of alcohol and so forth. Alcohol in itself is a toxicant substance and it only becomes intoxicant when mixed with water.6- Imam al-Nawawi said in al-Minhaj: \"filth includes every liquid intoxicant\". Thereupon, some Shafi'is doubted this and mentioned that there are some liquid intoxicants which are not filthy such as liquid hashish. The advocators of imam al-Nawawi interpreted his saying \"liquid\" as causing strong state of intoxication. Consequently, there is a consensus that not every liquid intoxicant is filth, and it is a condition for the liquid to cause a strong state of intoxication to consider it filth. However, imam al-Nawawi said in the section titled \"drinks\" of al-Minhaj: \"Any beverage that intoxicates when taken in large quantities is unlawful both in small and large quantities. The penalty for drinking [a liquid intoxicant] is obligatory enforced against anyone who drinks\".7- It is established [in the Shari'ah] that when the essence and characteristics of objects change, its legal ruling subsequently changes. For instance, filth becomes pure if it is mixed with much amount ofwater, and the color, taste and odor of water remain unchanged. Alcohol is not considered as wine if it is mixed with perfume, medicine or detergents. There is also consensus among scholars that if wine converts to vinegar, it is considered pure by the Shari'ah, even with chemists finding traces of alcohol in it.8- The Shafi's define filth as inexcusable impurity that invalidates prayer. Alcohol is not impure by itself; rather it is a natural detergent that has the ability to remove filth that water and soap can not remove. It is also used in manufacturing some perfumes and medicine compounds. It is merely a substance prepared for sterilizing structures and perfume. Claiming that such perfumes [containing alcohol] are considered as filth is a naturally rejected matter. In addition, perfume is not defined as wine either in language or common custom or usage. The absurd usage of alcohol through taking or drinking does not draw it away form being perfume.In his book Qawa'id al-Ahkam fi Masaleh al-Anam, the Shafi scholar 'Izz al-Deen Ibn Abd al-Salam said: \"The principle is that pure objects maintain good properties and impure (najis) objects maintain impure properties. Therefore, if juice turns to wine, it then becomes filth because it is considered impure by the Sahri'ah. However, if juice turns to vinegar, it is then pure because it is considered pure and approved by the Shari'ah. The same applies to the milk of animals that are eaten by [Muslims], nasal mucus, saliva, tears, sweat, the animals created from filth, fruits watered by impure water, the eggs of the animals that are eaten, musk and rennet [if taken from a slaughtered suckling lamb] all of the above objects are pure because they are turned to pure based state.Scholars differed over the ash of filth. Some scholars maintained that ash of filth is pure relying on the fact that its impure properties are transformed into pure ones. While filth becomes pure when its impure properties transform to purity, the same is the case with objects contaminated with filth where they become pure when filth is removed. Scholars also differed over tanning the hid of animals; some scholars maintained that purifying an animal hid through tanning means removing excess blood, fat, hair and so forth; others maintained that it is purified through being transformed into pure object and the rest maintained that it consists of both components\".The Maliki scholar, al-Qarafi said in his book al-Thakhira: \"There is a rule that clarifies what is mentioned above: Allah has limited filth to certain objects on the condition that such objects carry certain impure properties; otherwise all objects are pure. The difference that exists between objects in regard to filth and purity is relating to the properties of filth. There is a consensus that if the properties of filth attached to the object are completely disappeared, the object then is considered pure. For example, blood transforms to sperm and then to human being. On the other hand, if the properties of filth become greater, the object is then established as impure, such as the case when blood turns to pus, menstrual bleeding or dead. However, if the properties of filth attached to an object become lesser; in this case the degree of impurity is present in the object but is not its complete concentration. Therefore,the object in this case takes the same ruling that the scholars unanimously agreed upon. This is the general opinion of the scholars regarding this issue. Consequently, scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differentiated between wine that becomes vinegar as they declared it to be pure, and filthy bones become ash and declared it as filth because of the presence of impurities attached to it\".Sheikh Bakhit al-Muti'I has given a fatwa in 1351 A.H declaring that alcohol is not filth and it is not like wine. Dar al-Iftaa maintains this opinion and has issued fatwas on this subject during the time of Sheikh Muhammad Khatir in 27 Dhul Qi'dah 1391 A.H-13 January 1927 A.D. Sheikh Muhammad Rashid Reda approved this opinion, a group of the contemporary scholars and some of the authentic scientific institutions such as the legal fatawa issued by Fatawa sector in the Ministry of Endowments in Kuwait. Based on this, alcohol is not considered wine neither by the Shafi'is nor others. It is then permissible to use it in perfumes, detergents and medicine."

    "Question": "What is the ruling of using corrective contact lenses for both males and females? Taking into account that contact lenses can be colored, does wearing them deceive the viewer, fall under tampering with God’s creation, or exposing adornment to other than one's unmarriageable kin?",
    "Answer": "It is legally permissible to wear [colored] contact lenses as described above since it does not entail deceiving the onlooker as it is considered analogous to kohl which is a permissible external adornment. Wearing colored contact lenses does not entail changing Allah’s creation because they are analogous to dying the hair; the only difference between them is that the eyes are part of the face which is permissible to reveal, while it is impermissible to uncover the hair except in front of one’s unmarriageable kin and husband. The similarity between wearing colored contact lenses and dying the hair pertains only to the coloring process which is not considered changing what Allah has created, although it is unlawful to uncover the hair before anyone other than one’s unmarriageable kin. Based on the above, colored contact lenses are not among the unlawful adornments. And Allah Most High knows best."

    "Question": "What is the legal ruling regarding chatting with the other sex on the internet and if it is permissible, what are the boundaries of its permissibility?",
    "Answer": "The mere fact of conversing with the other sex is permissible in Islamic law without any legal impediment which hinders one or the two sexes from talking to each other as long as they keep the legal guidelines and as long as there is no locked door which prevent others from walking into the room in which the man and the woman are conducting the conversation.This is the established scholarly opinion of authentic scholars and the evidence on their legal stance is extracted from both the Quran and the Sunnah. In the Quran for example God says in the story of Prophet Moses and the two girls, He said, \"What is your circumstance?\" They said, \"We do not water until the shepherds dispatch [their flocks]; and our father is an old man.\" 28:32And from the Prophetic traditions, Abu Juhaifa narrated that when the Prophet (peace be upon him) allied in brotherhood between the Immigrants from Makkah (Muhajerin) and the helpers in Medinah (al Ansar) both Salman and Abu al Dardaa became brothers. So one day Sulaiman visited Abu al Dardaa at his home and saw his wife and she was upset so he asked her “what’s wrong?” and she replied “your brother Abu al Dardaa does not have any need for this world” (al Bukhari). Al Hafiz ibn Hajar in his book (Fath al Bari) commented on this hadith and said that we can extract from this hadith the permissibility of conversing with women and posing questions which would bring benefits.More importantly, not every seclusion is meant to be a prohibited seclusion as Bukhari and Muslim reported through the authority of Anas ibn Malik that a woman from the Ansar came to the Prophet so he sat alone with her and addressed her saying “by God you- the women of Ansar- are dear to my heart” and al Bukhari included this hadith under the chapter titled “Chapter on the permissibility of seclusion between a man and a woman when they are among people”. Al Hafiz ibn Hajar in his book (Fath al Bari) said that conversing with non mahram women secretly does not cause questioning one’s religiosity should there be no temptation. Mulla ‘Ali al Qari in his book “Mirqat al Mafatih” said that seclusion with a woman in the street is not the same as seclusion with a woman in a house. Sheikh al Shabramalsi al Shafi’i opined in his commentary on (Nihayat al Muhataj) that the prohibited private seclusion only occurs when the meeting of the two sexes is accompanied by a strong potential of temptation but if usually there is no room for temptation, seclusion is not prohibited.Also the Prophet’s wives used to teach male companions about juristic issues and convey God’s religion and the Islamic rulings on different issues. Volumes on the Prophetic traditions are filled with hadith traditions that are reported through the Prophet’s wives and the later generations of female companions and scholars who formed strong circles in the chain of narrating prophetic traditions along with delving into other Islamic sciences. Al Hafiz ibn Hajar al ‘Asqalani recorded in his book (al Isabah fi Tamyiz al Sahaba) the names of 1543 female scholars be it jurists, traditionists and intellectuals. Therefore conversing with the other gender online is permissible as long as the legal guidelines are kept intact."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5917/are-dogs-considered-impure-animals-how-about-cats",
    "Question": "Are dogs considered impure animals? How about cats?",
    "Answer": "The majority of scholars opined that dogs are impure and they based their opinion on what Abu Huraira narrated that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, “If a dog drank from a dish of yours, purify the dish by washing it seven times with dust being the first time”. So scholars said if the dog was not impure, the Prophet would not have commanded us to spill the water from which the dog drank because it would be considered a waste of money which the Islamic Shari’ah prohibits.Those who maintained the dog’s impurity, some of them obligated washing the dish seven times along with one time with dust and others have found it only recommended to wash it seven time and one time with dust as they maintained the opinion that impurity of the drunk water by dog is similar to other forms of impurities. The latter opinion was held by the Hanafis and they based their opinion on the hadith of Abu Hurairah in which the Prophet said, “If a dog drank from a dish, it should be washed three times”.Another group of scholars such as Imam Malik opined that the dog is pure because all living things are pure according to his legal school of jurisprudence. As for the command of spilling the water of the dish from which the dog drank and then washing the dish is a ritual act that is not subjected to reason. Therefore for the Malikis washing the dish does not indicate the impurity of the dog because impurities are not conditioned with a certain number. Therefore no command was found to spill anything from which the dog drank except water. Imam Malik supported his juristic opinion with the Quranic verse in which God says, “So eat of what they catch for you..” (5:4)So if the dog was impure in itself, then it would make what it hunted impure as well. Imam ibn Daqiq al ‘Eid said in his book “Ihkam al Ahkam Sharh ‘Umdat al Ahkam”that the Malikis supported their opinion regarding the purity of dogs through citing the example of the permissibility of dogs to hunt animals without persisting on its purity because hunting animals without touching them is very difficult. Another evidence that is cited by the Malikis to prove the purity of dogs is a hadith which reported by al Bukhari in which ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar stated that dogs used to come and go in the mosque at the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) without spraying anything on it. Imam Ibn Batal said that for dogs to come and go in the mosque usually entails wiping their nose, drinking water and eating leftovers because the mosque was the sleeping place for strangers and delegations. They eat in it and the mosque was also the living place for Ahl al Suffa. If dogs were impure, they would be prevented from entering the mosque because Muslims unanimously agree on the impressibility of impurities to enter mosques. Also the fact that dogs used to “come and go” indicates the repetitive nature of dogs’ entrance to the mosque and not forbidding their entrance indicates that they posses no impurity because impurity does not accompany living things.Although the majority of scholars maintain the impurity of dogs, this does not indicate harming dogs or killing them as the Islamic Shari’ah commanded Muslims to be kind and merciful to all animals and dogs are certainly included.As for cats, they are pure and this opinion is based on the Prophet’s hadith in which he said, “it is not impure. It is one of these creatures that live in our attendance” (Bukhari)"

    "Question": "I am a Muslim man and I am married to a Catholic Christian woman. We love each other but the issue is that she wants to name our baby boy “Ahmad Octavio”. Octavio is her father’s name and she loves him very much. Is this permissible?",
    "Answer": "Islam did not stipulate us to give certain names to our children, though it does require us to give them good names with beautiful meanings. This implies that we must refrain from names with bad meanings such as names of idols that are worshipped instead of God Almighty, names are repulsive in nature, or those that may cause embarrassment to a person.Furthermore, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) encouraged us to give beautiful names for our children. Abu Dawud reported through Abu al-Dardaa that the Prophet said, “You will be called on the Day of Judgment with your names and your father’s names so choose good names for yourselves.”And God Almighty knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5925/circulating-photos-of-humans-and-animals",
    "Question": "I import goods which include framed photos for desks and walls depicting men and women in wedding attire, couples on the beach, children etc… I also import telephone notepads with pictures of humans on their covers and small porcelain desk figurines in the shape of birds, children etc… to be given as gifts and put on display. What is the ruling for importing such goods—are they lawful or prohibited? What is to be done with the goods I already have?",
    "Answer": "There is no harm in circulating photos of humans and animals since they only capture light and are innocent of imitating Allah's creation, the prohibition against which the makers of depictions were strongly warned and if they are free of nudity and do not incite lust.StatuesIt is impermissible to manufacture or trade in statues if they are complete, do not entail any interest that calls for them or are made from an enduring material such as wood, metal or stone. This is indicated in the hadith of Sa'id Ibn Abu al-Hasan who said, \"I was with Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) when a man came up to him and said, 'O Ibn Abbas! My livelihood comes solely from the work I manufacture with my hands and I make these depictions! Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said, 'I will only tell you what I heard the Messenger of Allah say. He said that whoever makes a depiction, Allah will torture him until he breathes life in it, and he will never be able to do that.' At this, the man trembled and turned pale. Ibn Abbas told him, \"Woe unto you! If you must, depict trees and other inanimate objects\" [Bukhari and Muslim]. There are other similar hadiths prohibiting depictions which scholars have interpreted to indicate statues as can be deduced from the context of the above hadith.Just as it is prohibited to manufacture and trade in statues, it is likewise prohibited to acquire them due to the words of the Prophet who said, \"The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a depiction\" [Bukhari and Muslim]. This concerns a complete statue. However, if it is incomplete such that the depicted creature cannot remain alive without the missing organ, then it is permissible to manufacture, trade in or acquire it. Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, \"Jibril (peace be upon him) came to me and said, 'I visited you yesterday and nothing prevented me from entering except some statues by the door. Order someone to remove the heads of any statues in the house so that they resemble trees\" [recorded by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi ]. Ibn Abbas said, \"The depiction pertains to the head. If the head is removed, then it is not a depiction\" [Narrated in both a raised chain and a halted chain hadith through Al-Baihaqi and others].ExceptionsExempted from the prohibition is any statue that entails benefit such as children's toys and educational illustrative figures since the Prophet permitted 'A`isha's dolls. Asbugh Ibn al-Farag, the Maliki scholar, permitted statues made from candy and dough. Some scholars restricted the prohibition of statues to those meant to imitate the creative act of Allah although this is a weak opinion.The rulingBased on the above and in reference to the question, whoever trades in such goods must adhere to the previously mentioned legal standards concerning both permissibility and prohibition. Additionally, he must avoid pictures containing nudity which expose those parts of the body that Allah ordered to be concealed. It is permissible for the inquirer to sell the figurines in his possession following the opinion of those scholars who restrict the prohibition to an intentional emulation of the creation of Allah. This is because the figurines are not complete imitations."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5947/is-there-a-contradiction-between-someone-being-a-disbeliever-and-dealing-with-him",
    "Question": "There is a debate in the Muslim Ummah regarding the way of dealing with the people of the book and are they really disbelievers (kuffar)?",
    "Answer": "Some people get confused when they try to combine between the religious ruling pertinent to the people of the book and between dealing with them. Most people don’t understand whether the people of the book are believers or not and if they were not believers, how can we deal with them?If we want to understand this issue deeply, we need to divide this topic into two parts. The first part has to do with theology and to clarify this part we need to know the elements of faith which is the belief in God, His angels, His messengers, His books and the Last Day. Therefore whoever believes in all these elements is a believer and whoever denies any of it, is not a believer. In other words, for a believer he or she has to believe in all of God’s revealed books and all of His messengers and whoever denies even one messenger or one book is not deemed a believer even if he believes in the remaining elements of faith. This ruling applies on the people of the book who deny the prophethood of Prophet Muhammad and the book that was revealed on him (the Quran).Same ruling applies on Muslims should they deny the prophethood of Moses or Jesus or denied the existence of the Torah or the Bible. One of the most all encompassing verses which combine all the elements of faith together says, “The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers. All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers, [saying], \"We make no distinction between any of His messengers.\" And they say, \"We hear and we obey. [We seek] Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final] destination.\" 2:285As for the second part, it has to do with how to deal with non Muslims especially if they are from the people of the book because they have an advantage over others. This advantage allows Muslims to marry from them and eat their slaughtered animals and one of the famous verses on this issue is “And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, \"We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.\" 29:46Therefore, there is no contradiction between someone being a disbeliever and between treating him good because being a disbeliever is a theological matter as disbelief in the Arabic linguistic means covering some elements of faith. The fact of someone being a disbeliever which is a theological matter does not contradict the necessity of dealing with him or her in a good manner. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) dealt with disbelievers with wisdom, good manners and fine etiquette. God says, “Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided.” 16:125The problem of those who misunderstand Islam is that they erroneously think that just because a person is a disbeliever, this theological fact gives them the permission of mistreating them and even shedding their blood. This extreme thinking occurs due to concluding erroneous results that are built on sound introductions. And these erroneous results have nothing to do with the essential basis of good manners and coexistence that guide the relationship between Muslims and non Muslims."

    "Question": "I am a young Scandinavian woman and I embraced Islam five years ago and none of my family members is a Muslim. One of my relatives died and I was wondering if it is permissible for me to attend the burial rituals which will be conducted in the church?",
    "Answer": "There is no legal impediment to hold you back from attending your non Muslim friends and relatives’ funerals. Imam al Nawawi said in his book (al Majmu’) “it is not a disfavored act for a Muslim to attend the funeral of a non Muslim relative” and this was also stated by Imam al Shafi’i.Also attending the funeral of a relative even if he is a non Muslim strengthens the ties of kinship which is commanded by Islamic Shari’ah. It is also important to attend the relatives’ funerals as a token of refined manners, good relationship with others, loyalty and love. Similarly attending the funeral of your relative would increase respect and admiration for Islam in your family and would give a positive impression that Islam promotes coexistence and harmony.Also there is no impediment to offer your condolences because it is part of good manners and high ethics as God says in the Quran, “Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.” 60: 8 and also said, “and [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], \"Do not worship except Allah; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy. And speak to people good [words] … 2:83” so condolences are part of speaking goodness to people.We also advise the questioner to be kind and lenient with her family and relatives to become a role model of a good Muslim who engages in his/ her community as Islam does not like his followers to be isolated in their little cocoons. Islam was rather spread through refined manners and sharing people’s moments of joy and sadness along with offering them a supporting hand coated with empathy and mercy for them."

    "Question": "Am I obliged to follow only one of the four sunni legal schools of jurisprudence? Are there any other options that one can follow?",
    "Answer": "Regarding this issue, there is a difference between learning and applying. When it comes to applying, abiding by a certain legal school of jurisprudence for lay people is not obligatory in every matter as they are eligible to adopt the legal opinion of other juristic scholars and mujtahids. Therefore, lay people have no certain legal school of jurisprudence because they follow the juristic opinion of the scholar they ask.This is the established opinion for the Hanafis. The renowned Hanafi scholar Ibn ‘Abdeen stated in his commentary in reference to Imam al Sharnibali that he said, “one does not have to abide by a certain legal school and he is permitted to follow an opinion which opposes the opinion of the juristic legal school which he follows. He is allowed to adopt two opposite opinions in two separate incidents that are not related to each other. He is not permitted to nullify an action he did by the virtue of following the juristic opinion of another scholar because engaging in an action is similar to passing a verdict by a judge with no appeal.This opinion is supported with God as He asserted the obligation of following scholars in general with no specification or dedication to one scholar over the other. God says in the Quran, “So ask the people of knowledge if you do not know” 16:43. Also when people posed their questions at the time of the Prophet’s companions and the scholars of the next generation, they did not abide by a certain school but they rather asked eligible scholars without limiting themselves with the opinion of someone while denying the opinion of the other.Following one of the opinions of the mujtahids (eligible scholars who practice independent legal reasoning) is in fact following the truth. All the mujtahid scholars are correct and this means that each of them follows his own independent legal reasoning which led him to believe in the validity of the concluded ruling. As one chooses to follow any of the scholarly opinions of these renowned mujtahids, he/she should not believe that this is the only correct juristic opinions and other opinions are invalid.As for the issue of learning and studying different legal schools of jurisprudence, following a certain school of jurisprudence is inevitable. The four Sunni legal schools of jurisprudence were well served and deeply studied by generations of renowned scholars in a way that other schools of jurisprudence were not subjected to. The four schools were well edited and the popular and favored opinions were highlighted and backed with authentic supporting evidence. The biographies of the renowned scholars of each school were documented and their methodologies of deriving juristic legal rulings were scrutinized so each of them became an independent school of jurisprudence that benefits those who seek religious knowledge."

    "Question": "I had a conversation with one of my Muslim friends who thinks that Jews and Christians are not disbelievers as disbelief only occurs to the one who denies the existence of God. My opinion is that denying God is not the only reason of disbelief. Would you clarify this please?",
    "Answer": "Disbelief has more than one meaning. There is a kind of disbelief which is atheism and this is what your friends meant by this kind of disbelief which indicates the non existence of God. Another meaning of disbelief is disbelieving in Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and this meaning is the one that is meant by Muslims when they call someone as a disbeliever. This understanding of disbelief versus Islam does not necessitate atheism or disbelieving in God because Islam is an open system which does not differentiate between prophets. Therefore Muslims reached a consensus that whoever disbelieves in any of God’s prophet while his message is well conveyed to him is a disbeliever even if he admitted the existence of God and believed in all the rest of God’s prophets. Therefore, whoever disbelieves in Prophet Moses is a disbeliever and same goes for whoever disbelieves in Prophet Muahmmad after the Prophet’s message was well conveyed to him."

    "Question": "I just joined an interfaith group, because the local church sponsored some Muslim Somali refugee family of 5 females (mother plus 4 daughters) and they also wanted some Muslims to help out.",
    "Answer": "The principle in the relationship between Muslims and non-Muslims is coexistence. Muslims living in non-Muslim countries have to engage in their communities while observing their Muslim identity. It is legally impermissible for Muslims to share non-Muslims in anything that violates the fundamentals of Islamic law. Rather, it is permissible for Muslims to speak kindly and participate with non-Muslims in a manner that does not contradict the commands of Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him).There is no doubt that maintaining ties with non-Muslims by exchanging visits, offering condolences and good wishes, exchanging gifts and the like are from among kind treatment. This is considered one of the ways towards calling to the religion of Allah through noble manners.Allah the Almighty commands us to speak kind words to everyone alike. He says, Speak fair to people. (Al-Baqarah 2:83) Allah also commands us to always be kind to others. He says, Allah commands justice and the doing of good. (An-Nahl, 90)Allah does not forbid us from maintaining good ties with non-Muslims, exchanging gifts or other acts of kind treatment. Allah the Almighty says, Allah forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for (your) faith nor derive you out of your homes from dealing kindly and justly with them: for Allah loves those who are just. (Al-Mumtahana,8).All of such good actions must be carried out while observing one's Muslim identity.There is no legal objection to visiting a church with the purpose of advocating and introducing Islam or offering compliments on certain occasion within the limits of the above mentioned. Likewise, it is permissible to perform prayers inside the church if its time entered while you are therein and after taking the consent of those in charge.As for reading, studying and discussing the bible, it must be done by specialized scholars who are well versed in points of doubts and possessing the tools of understating interfaith dialogue."

    "Question": "Assalamu AlaikumWe know that Islam secures freedom of belief. This is clear from many quranic verses but my question is did Prophet Muhammad really force people to become Muslims? If not, then why he fought non Muslims? Please clarify this very important isssue. Jazakum Allahu Khairan.Was-Salam",
    "Answer": "Coexistence in Islam The principle underlying the relationship between Muslims and non- Muslims is coexistence. Allah commands Muslims to treat other people kindly provided they do not manifestly declare malice towards them and to think well of all of people alike. A person who thoroughly explores the verses of the noble Qur`an will find that, in its entirety, it presents an integrated Qur`anic methodology concerning the treatment of non-Muslims. It is noteworthy to mention that the variation in the manner of treating non-Muslims does not stem from a methodological inconsistency; rather, it depends on the different attitudes of the people we deal with. People are different [with respect to behavior] and thus they must not be judged alike. It is considered a methodical injustice to generalize what has been made specific or to specify what has been left general in legal texts. Just as there are individuals who accept Muslims' beliefs, there are others who differ with them. Among this latter group, there are some who merely present their opinions or beliefs and those who go as far as to attack those who differ with them. Therefore, both groups are treated differently. Evidence from Qur`an There are many verses in the Qur`an, whether those revealed in Mecca or Medina, that urge Muslims to be tolerant towards others and to treat them kindly. These include:So pardon and overlook until Allah delivers His command. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent. [Al-Baqarah: 109] There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. [Al-Baqarah: 256] Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly. [Al-Mumtahana, 8] The above verses from Surah al-Baqarah and al-Mumtahana were revealed in Medina and all of them exhort Muslims to be kind and merciful to their fellow men. As for the legal texts [Qur`an and Sunnah] that command Muslims to be harsh towards some people, they can be compared to the previous verses as two integrated methodologies that deal with two different types of people:The first methodology, which is the general case, enjoins Muslims to treat all people with kindness through dialogue and respect of freedom [of faith]. This is the correct basis for inviting others to Islam; this does not abrogate a Qur`anic verse nor has it been abrogated though some jurists claim the contrary. Allah Almighty says,And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zakah. [Al-Baqarah: 83] In another verse, Allah instructs those who call others to His way on how they should invite others according to the different types of people: Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided. [An-Nahl: 125]Allah says about the People of the Book,And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, \"We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him. [Al-'Ankabut: 46] The second methodology is concerned with those who attack Muslims, in which case it is necessary to defend oneself even in a harsh manner. Allah Almighty says,[Fighting in] the sacred month is for [aggression committed in] the sacred month, and for [all] violations is legal retribution. So whoever has assaulted you, then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you. And fear Allah and know that Allah is with those who fear Him. [Al-Baqarah: 194] Unlike the policy followed by some countries, Muslims do not treat others based on whether they are with or against them. Rather, Islam teaches its followers that people are different and must therefore be treated accordingly with respect to time and type of person. Based on the above, one can understand the hadith which exhorts fighting non-Muslims until they testify that there is no god but Allah as fighting the aggressors who attack Muslims and not people in general. It also means that Muslims must merely deliver the message of Islam to them and not compel them to embrace the faith as per the words of Allah Almighty Who says: Fight them until there is no [more] temptation [fitnah] and [until] worship is [acknowledged to be] for Allah. But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors. [Al-Baqarah: 193] In the hadith mentioned above, the Prophet (PBUH) refers to the apostates led by Musailamah who attempted to destroy the Islamic state and deviate from its general order. This was clearly a case of high treason, a charge that carries the death penalty according to penal codes and international laws. The same applies to the above noble verse which speaks about a group of oppressors who share the same abominable characteristics. At that time, the Romans started to mobilize armies to fight the Prophet (PBUH). The Muslims did not fight them except after they learned that the Romans wanted to abolish the Islamic state."

    "Question": "I am a German Muslim and my father, who was not a Muslim, died recently. My father was a kind and charitable man. He loved to do good so much that I can easily say that he displayed Islamic behavior throughout his life though he never actually embraced Islam. I really want to pray to God to forgive him and have mercy on his soul but some people told me that it is impermissible to pray for non- Muslims.",
    "Answer": "God Almighty is more merciful towards those He created than they are towards themselves. He described his beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a mercy to all the worlds and that he has the finest manners.Prophet Muhammad admired good manners and praised high morals and ethics regardless of religious affiliation. For instance, when the daughter of Abu Hatem al Tai fell captive to the Muslims, the Prophet ordered her release on account of her father’s renowned generosity and impeccable ethics. Upon this, one of the Companions stood up and asked, “O Messenger of God! Does God love superior ethics?” The Prophet replied, “I swear by He Who owns my soul, no one will enter paradise except one who has good manners.”More importantly, the rulings of this world differ from the rulings of the next. In this world, a person’s outer state may indicate that he is not a Muslim though he may not have shown signs of disbelief in Islam. This however, does not necessitate that he go to hellfire or even stay in it for eternity. God may excuse and pardon a person for not being exposed to the message of Islam effectively. Such a person could be among those who will be tested on the Day of Judgment. God says in the Quran, “It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire” (Quran 9:113).According to this verse, God prohibits asking for forgiveness only for those whose fate in hellfire is certain. Otherwise, there is no reason not to ask for forgiveness for those whose fate is not determined. The torture of some of the inhabitants of hellfire will be reduced due to prayers and it was reported that some of those in hellfire will receive a lesser punishment because of the blessings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Therefore, there is no limit to God’s mercy and generosity and there is no impediment to hold you back from praying for your deceased father by seeking God’s forgiveness for him and hoping that He accepts your intercession for your father.God the Almighty knows best."

He wrote the new apartment in one of his daughters' name because he was not eligible to reserve an apartment. What is the ruling of Islamic law on this debt?",
    "Answer": "If the case is indeed as stated in the question, then we determine the following:The loanThe money that the inquirer's husband borrowed to purchase a family apartment is a debt owed on the estate. It is to be deducted from the estate before it is divided among the heirs. It must not be deducted from the shares of some heirs apart from others, whether some of them live in the apartment, benefit from it or for any other reason.The condolence meeting expensesThe deceased's brother is to solely bear the expenses of the condolence meeting because the only expenses that are deducted from the estate of a deceased are those for washing his body, shrouding and burying him. The condolence meeting expenses and any others are considered voluntary expenses and no one is to bear them except the person who made them.Notice of inheritance expensesIf there was a need to issue a notice of inheritance from which all the heirs would benefit, then they must all contribute towards the fees of the lawyer whom the inquirer hired for this purpose.

This is unlike commutative contracts which recognize only minor gharar that does not lead to disputes, as dictated by Islamic law.The Rulingo It is lawful to claim compensations.o It is permissible for attorneys to file compensation claims against insurance companies and receive fees for their work, provided they engage in their work with honesty, without fraud, deception or unlawful acquisition of funds."

    "Question": "What is the diyya (blood money) for losing a single eye?",
    "Answer": "The Messenger of Allahsaid, \"There is a diyya for the eyes.\"[Recorded by Al-Nisa`i, al-Dharmi and al-Baihaqi].Consequently, this means that half the diyya is due for losing a single eye.DefinitionThe diyya is an obligatory sum paid in compensation to the victim or his family for a crime committed against him. Its obligatoriness is established by the Qur`an, sunnah and scholarly consensus. In the Quran, Allah the Almighty says,Pay compensation to the victim's relatives, unless they charitably forgo it. [Al-Nisaa`, 92]Abu Bakr Ibn Mohammed Ibn 'Amr Ibn Hazm narrated through his father who narrated through his own father that the Messenger of Allahwrote to the people of Yemen and said, \"If a believer is unjustly killed and there are witnesses to the crime, the offender is to receive his penalty unless the victim's relatives forgive him. The diyya for a victim's life is 100 camels, the life of a man for a woman's, and 1000 dinars from those [living in a place where] goods are computed in terms of gold\" [Al-Nisa`i]. The Muslim community is unanimous on the obligation of the diyya.The amount of diyyaThe majority of scholars have maintained that the diyya of a free Muslim male is 100 camels (or their equivalent) from a person living in a place where goods are computed in terms of the value of camels, 200 cows (or their equivalent) from a person living in a place where goods are computed in terms of the value of cows, 12, 000 dirhams from a person living in a place where goods are computed in terms of silver, and 200hulla [a paired garment] (or their equivalent) from a person living in a place where goods are computed in terms of the value of hullal. These estimates were laid down by the Messenger of Allah.If the victim's guardian chooses to accept the diyya, he is to take whatever type is presented to him even if it is not the vehicle of exchange where he lives. This is because the offender has satisfied the applicable pecuniary compensation.The amount of diyya and method of paymentSince this system does not suit all cases of diyya at present, we opine that it should be paid from the least valuable of the prescribed categories which is silver; based on the principle of freedom of liability from anything in surplus of the prescribed amount. Based on this, the diyya is 12, 000 dirhams. According to the majority of scholars, a dirham is 2 kg 975 g of silver approximately, so the overall diyya would be 35 kg 700 g of silver, to be calculated according to the market price of the day on which the diyya is established either by agreement between the concerned parties or the courts. It may be paid in installments over a period of not less than three years. If the offender's family does not have the resources, the murderer is to pay the diyya himself. If not, it is permissible for others to pay it on his behalf even if from zakat funds.The diyya of a womanThe majority of scholars have maintained that the diyya of a woman is half of that of a man. They based their opinion on Al-Baihaqi's narration who transmitted it from Mo'az Ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) who reported that the Prophet said,\"The diyya of a woman is half of that of a man\" [Al-Baihaqi said that the hadith has a very weak chain of transmitters]. Al-Assamm and Ibn 'Ulaya contended otherwise; according to them the diyya of a woman is the same as that of a man. The diyya, in practice and the opinion implemented for fatwa, is based on the opinion of the majority of scholars due to the above hadith and other similar ones.Diyya for involuntary manslaughterAge is not a factor in the determination of the diyya for an involuntary manslaughter. It is permissible to forgive the offender and waive one's claim to diyya or accept a smaller payment based on the Qur`anic verses, Pay compensation to the victim's relatives, unless they charitably forgo it [An-Nisaa`, 92]But if the culprit is pardoned by his aggrieved brother, this shall be adhered to fairly, and the culprit shall pay what is due in a good way. This is alleviation from your Lord and an act of mercy. If anyone then exceeds these limits, grievous suffering then awaits for him [Al-Baqarah, 178].The Wise Lawgiver has authorized the victim's family to waive its right to the diyya or to part of it if the murderer is unable to pay the full amount or part of it. On the other hand, it is permissible for the victim's family to accept it in full because it is their right."

    "Answer": "Definition of a contract It is a bilateral agreement that gives rise to manifest results concerning the item in question. To be binding, a contract is not concluded except if there is a firm conviction as to its bindingness. If not, it is merely a promise of ratification and promises are not binding according to the opinion of the majority of scholars.According to the most correct opinion, the penalty clause is neither completely forbidden nor permitted. It is valid in case actual harm arises and estimated according to the extent of the harm and not according to what the parties to the contract have actually agreed upon.The rulingThe words of the inquirer's father to the first buyer were merely a promise of sale and Surat al-Fatiha was recited to confirm this promise.Reciting Surat al-Fatiha does not render the agreement more than a mere promise of sale.The transaction between the inquirer's father and the second buyer is a valid contract that has been effected by mutual consent, and documented in writing and by the exchange of money. Consequently, the first buyer is not entitled to anything, especially since the inquirer's father stipulated that their agreement is revoked if the buyer does not make a down payment.The second contract is valid and the penalty clause is estimated according to the extent of the harm, if any.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "The petitioner's father owns a number of palm trees. He would sell their fruits before they ripened and receive the price in monthly installments. What is the legal ruling for this?",
    "Answer": "The Hanbali scholars, Harb al-Karmani and Abu al-Wafa` Ibn 'Uqail, maintained that this form of transaction is rectified by changing the sale contract into a rental one. Ibn Taimiyya chose this opinion and maintained that it is tantamount to the consensus of the salaf [predecessors]. However, it is well known that the scholars of the four followed schools of jurisprudence contended differently. Harb al-Karamani mentioned that Sa'id Ibn Mansur narrated, \"'Ubad Ibn 'Ubad related to us through Hisham Ibn 'Urwa through his father who said that Asid Ibn Hudayr passed away while he was indebted with six thousand dirhams. So 'Umar called his creditors and rented out to them Usayd's land, which included palms and other trees, for several years.\" In this instance, renting is permissible because a benefit is derived while the source itself remains constant and is renewable by Allah. This corresponds to benefits such as fruits from trees, milk from a wet nurse, and wool from sheep.The ruling It is permissible for the owner to rent his palm trees or other trees to the trader who will irrigate and fertilize them, ward off tree damage, and harvest their fruits for a determined period in return for a known fee. Therefore, this does not fall under the Prophet's prohibition concerning selling unripe produce. Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "A woman put out an advertisement for her work as a merchant in the following manner:She shows her clients the commodities she has or describes to them those which she does not have. She then purchases the items they choose and sells them to her clients in installments with profit. Please note that some people consider such transactions to be forbidden. They maintain that she is not entitled to trade in all commodities and that she must have the commodities in her possession and not merely buy them according to her clients' wishes. According to them, such transactions do not subject her to loss which is among the conditions of trade.",
    "Answer": "Based on the opinion of the majority of scholars, it is established in Islamic law that transactions involving selling for either immediate or deferred payment for a determinately known maturity date are valid. This is because such transactions are a form of murabaha.What is murabaha?It is a transaction sanctioned in Islamic law in which it is permissible for the seller to stipulate an increase in price in return for deferring payment. This is because even though the deferment does not equal real currency, in murabaha there is an increase in price in exchange for deferment when a specific date is mentioned. Conditions include:- Attaining an agreement between the parties involved.- There is nothing to prevent such a sale.- The people are in need of it, whether they are buyers or sellers.Trading in commoditiesThe claims that a merchant is not entitled to trade in all commodities but must stick to one product and that his trade must be subject to loss amount to speaking on behalf of Allah without knowledge.Selling what one does not haveIt is valid to sell a commodity before taking possession of it in the context of a salam transaction (buying in advance) which involves selling described merchandise which the seller is under obligation to deliver to the buyer. Its permissibility is evidenced by the Qur`an, sunnah, and scholarly consensus.Allah the Almighty says,O ye who believe! When ye deal with each other, in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period of time … [Al-Baqarah: 282]Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said, \"This verse was revealed in relation to salam sale.\"The Prophet said, \"Whoever enters into a [salam] contract for dates should do so for a determinately known measure, weight and date\" [recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim]. A salam transaction is most manifest in a sale involving a conventional commodity such as a refrigerator of a certain brand, capacity, color and features.The kind of sale mentioned in the question can be amended in the following manner:- The merchant agrees with the buyer on the commodity the latter wishes to buy from him;- The merchant buys it first;- The merchant then sells it to his client. In this instance, the transaction is considered the permissible sale of a commodity in the merchant's possession and not from among the prohibited transactions involving the sale of absent goods. Furthermore, the buyer can accompany the merchant to the place from where he will buy the desired commodity. Then the merchant buys the commodity and sells it to the buyer on credit. The merchant may also commission the buyer to buy the commodity on his behalf in cash. The buyer then purchases it from him and pays in installments. There is no doubt concerning the lawfulness of this transaction — it benefits both parties and facilitates matters for both without contravening Islamic law.The rulingBased on the above, this woman's work is permissible if conducted in the manner described above.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Is it permissible for a grandfather to use a power of attorney from his deceased son, after his the death of this son, to sell his son’s share in something to his other son? To what extent is this considered to be a legal contract?",
    "Answer": "A power of attorney is an instrument authorizing another to act as one's agent in things which are possible to undertake on another's behalf during one's lifetime. It is legitimate, since Allah the Almighty says:Appoint one arbiter from his family and one from hers.[4:35]Authorizing another to act on one's behalf is likewise permissible based on what was narrated that the Prophet delegated messengers to collect zakat. In addition to this, the Messenger of Allāh appointed ‘Amr Ibn ‘Umayyah al-Damri to act as his agent in his marriage to Umm Habibaba.1 It is a prerequisite that it be valid for the grantor to engage in transactions. A power of attorney becomes invalid when either the agent or the grantor ceases to be qualified to engage in transactions, through death or insanity. So it is not permissible for the agent to engage in what one was commissioned to do after the death of the grantor.The rulingBased on the above, it is not permissible for the grandfather to use the power of attorney to sell the share of his deceased son—the grantor—to his living brother.

    "Question": "What is the ruling for selling gold in installments?",
    "Answer": "The prohibition of selling gold for gold and silver for silver on credit has been mentioned in several hadiths including the one of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) who reported that the Messenger of Allah said, \"Do not sell gold for gold except for equivalent weight; do not sell silver for silver except for equivalent weight; do not increase one over the other and do not defer payment or delivery of goods\" [Recorded by Bukhari and others].Scholars are unanimous that if the exchanged commodities (where gain is unlawful and considered usurious) are different in kind but share the same ratio legis (illa) such as for instance, the ratio legis of gold and silver is their being monetary instruments, then such an exchange must be hand to hand. Deferment is prohibited whether it is stipulated in a contract or actually made.Because they are manufactured, gold and silver jewelry are not considered mediums of exchange. Consequently, the ratio legis (their being monetary instruments) categorizing them as usurious commodities and which gives rise to the prohibition of inequivalency or deferment, is absent. They are therefore like any other commodity that is sold and bought for either immediate or deferred payment. It is known that a ruling revolves around the presence or absence of its ratio legis. This is the position of Ibn Taymiyyah, his student Ibn Al-Qayyim and others who stipulated that the jewelry must not be of the gold jewelry that has been specifically crafted for men and which is prohibited for them to wear without a dispensation. Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote in his book I'lam Al-Muwaqa'in: \"Permissible jewelry becomes, by virtue of permissible craftsmanship, of the same class as clothing and merchandise and not of the same class as monetary instruments. It is for this reason that it is not zakatable. Therefore, no usury is involved when it is exchanged for monetary instruments, whether or not of the same kind, just as no usury is involved in the exchange between monetary instruments and all other kinds of commodities. By virtue of its craftsmanship, permissible gold jewelry has ceased to be a medium of exchange but has become a tradable object. Therefore, there is no sin in trading it against its kind.\"The rulingBased on the above, there is no legal objection to selling gold jewelry in installments. It is not obligatory to pay its price in cash at the time of the sale."

I want to exchange the land on which the restrooms are built (which does not exceed 18 square meters) for 200 square meters of my own land to build an entryway to my house. The piece of land I will give to the mosque lies in the direction of the qibla and will facilitate expansion of the mosque.",
    "Answer": "The principle is that it is impermissible to substitute an endowment for another except for a genuine benefit determined by the courts and not by the layman. Some scholars have maintained that it is permissible to substitute an endowment, disregarding the conditions laid down by the endower, with the permission of the courts though only if this is in the interest of the endowment itself. Other scholars strictly forbid this for fear that the administrators may forfeit the endowment or its substitute. However, when the substitution can be safely implemented and it is possible to prevent any squandering on the part of the administrators, the court is entitled to rule in favor of substituting the entire endowment or part of it if the interest lies therein.Textual evidenceIbn Nujaim, the author of Al-Bahr Al-Ra`iq Sharh Kinz Al-Daqa`iq said, \"According to Abu Yusuf, it is permissible to substitute an endowment for another which generates more revenues and is located in a better area. Otherwise, it is impermissible.\" Quoting fom Sharh Mandhumit Ibn Wahban, Ibn Nujaim further said, \"Is substitution permissible if the endower stipulates that the endowment is not to be replaced with another, if its administrator is dismissed before substitution is implemented or is dismissed because of his decision to substitute the endowment?' Al-Tarsusi said, \"There is no text on this matter and according to the opinion adopted by the Hanafi School of Jurisprudence, the court is to substitute the endowment if benefit lies therein because the condition stipulated by the endower against any court interference is null and void. The court has the authority to decide due to its overriding knowledge and case evaluation. Because the [above] condition involves forfeiting the interests of the beneficiaries and suspending the endowment, it is considered ineffectual and therefore unacceptable.\"There is no doubt that what is meant here by benefit and maslahah mu'tabara (recognized public interest) is the exclusive interest of the mosque. The court is the only instrument entrusted with deciding whether there is a real necessity for replacing the endowment.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Al SlamoAlikom,I heard a Sheikh on TV saying that working at banks is an act of unrighteousness. So is it haram or prohibited then to work for banks?Thanks & Regards,",
    "Answer": "Since the emergence of banks in the modern age, jurists have disagreed on how they conceive the nature of banks. Their differences parallel the disagreement between scholars of conventional law and economists over whether the relationship between banks and their clients is one of lending (held by scholars of conventional law), or one of investment (held by economists). Built upon this difference in conception (Ar. taswir) is a difference in legal formulation (Ar. Takyif).The jursits who consider this relationship to be financial lending formulate it as a loan which has brought benefit to the lender. Thus, its ruling would be based on it being unlawful usury. But then the fatwa differed, because some considered this a matter of necessities that are permissible for a Muslim to undertake whenever he is forced to, and is thus based upon the principle of ‘Necessities render the forbidden permissible’, which [in turn] is deduced from the all-encompassing words of Allah:But if anyone is forced to eat such things by hunger, rather than desire or excess, he commits no sin. [2:173]Other jurists maintain that this does not fall under the heading of necessities since necessity is legally defined as ‘something without which one would perish or come close to perishing’.Some of the jurists amongst this group maintain that it is permissible, based upon the principle of need being given the status of necessities - whether those needs are common or individual.As for the jurists who followed the formulation that the relationship between banks and clients is a relationship based upon investment: some of them consider it an invalid profit sharing venture [mudarabah] that can be rectified by combining it with a lease. Others member of this group maintain that it is a new transaction and a new type of contract which has no name in traditional Islamic law. Thus, they studied the matter in depth, just as the legists of Samarqand researched bay‘ al-wafa’ out of considering it a new type of contract. Likewise, the Shaykh al-Islam Abu al-Su‘ud researched ‘aqd al-mu‘amalah and ruled in favor of its lawfulness – just as the former scholars ruled with the lawfulness of bay‘ al-wafa’. They arrived at this judgment because they took into account the interests of the people and their dire need for these types of contracts; and because it was a means for market reform, and the masses depended on them for their livelihood. Moreover, it suited the demands of the age’s [new] developments in transportation and communication, and modern technology; population growth; weakened social relations; the development of accounting sciences and book-keeping; and separation between legal entities [e.g. corporations] and individuals, and many other {novel matters}In brief, there is a difference of opinion concerning the issue of working in bank transactions and transacting with banks: how it is conceived and formulated, and its legal ruling in theory and in application. The established legal maxims are:1. Objection is reserved for omitting what is agreed to be a requirement, and performing something that is agreed to be unlawful. Objection is not for issues where there is a difference of opinion.2. It is recommended to remove oneself from controversial issues.3. Whoever is afflicted with something controversial must follow the opinion of those who permit it.It is necessarily known in Islam that usury is prohibited. This is because its prohibition has been stated explicitly in the Qur’an and Prophetic hadith, and because of the unanimous consensus of the Muslim community. Allah the Almighty says:But those who take usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by Satan’s touch. That is because they say, ‘Trade and usury are the same,' but God has allowed trade and forbidden usury. Whoever, on receiving God’s warning, stops taking usury may keep his past gains—God will be his judge—but whoever goes back to usury will be an inhabitant of the Fire, there to remain. [2:275]The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him and his family) said: Allah curses those who take usury, those who give it, those who witness it, and those who record it. [Bukhari and Muslim]However, the controversy revolves around the true nature of what is derived from banks: whether it is an instance of usury (which is unlawful) or invalid contracts (which are unlawful); or a new form of contract which would be permissible if it achieves the interests of the parties involved and is free of anything which is legally prohibited.Based on the above, every Muslim must realize that Allah the Almighty prohibited usury and that there is unanimous consensus concerning its prohibition. He must realize that concerning bank transactions, scholars [in all parts of] the world differ in conceiving, formulating, and arriving at its legal status in theory and in application. He must also realize that it is recommended to remove oneself from controversial issues. Nonetheless, he may follow those who permit it; in such a case, there is no prohibition involved in any form of banking activity: depositing or borrowing money, working in or transacting with them, and so forth.And Allah the Almighty knows best"

    "Question": "What is the legal ruling for establishing factories manufacturing metals used in fabricating water pipes?",
    "Answer": "Islam has prohibited everything that harms man both physically or psychologically. Allah Almighty says: Who commands them to do the right and forbids them to do wrong [7:157].Good things include what benefits man both physically and psychologically while bad things include what harms him physically, psychologically, or both. Allah Almighty says: Do not contribute to your destruction with your own hands [2:195] and our master, the Prophet , said: \"Do not cause harm and do not reciprocate harm\".It has been proved that smoking, in all its various forms, is harmful to health and therefore unlawful. Assistance towards a prohibition is a prohibition in itself because means are given the same rulings as their goals.Based on this and in reference to the question, it is impermissible for the inquirer to establish the above mentioned factory.The answer to the question is known from the above and Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling on purchasing an apartment through a bank? The buyer pays a down payment and the bank pays the rest of its price on his behalf. The buyer then pays the bank in installments with an agreed upon increase in price.",
    "Answer": "Cash and deferred payments are permissible in Islamic law. An increase in price in exchange for deferment is permissible according to the opinion of the majority of scholars because it is a form of murabaha.MurabahaIt is a sale in which it is permissible to stipulate an increase in price in exchange for deferring payment.Even though deferment is not considered real currency, in murabaha, there is an increase in price for deferment. The objective is to conclude the sale when there is an agreement between the two parties, there is no objection to the sale and people, buyers and sellers, are in need of it.In this scenario the bank is considered the mediator; it purchases an item or part of it and owns it either by right or by possession. The buyer then purchases the item from the bank in installments with an increase in price in exchange for deferring payment to a known maturity date.Although, this transaction is sometimes called a loan, it is actually selling in installments. It is permissible due to the legal maxim: \"If a commodity comes between two parties there is no riba involved\".Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Answer": "If the case is as mentioned in the question, it is obligatory upon the inquirer's brother-in-law to do either of the following:- Give the inquirer the amount of gold that could have been purchased by 1000 EGP six years ago; or,- give the inquirer the equivalent sum of the gold according to the current price.And God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "I work at the National Laboratory for Quality Control of Poultry Products at the Ministry of Agriculture, the body responsible for diagnosing and conducting researches on avian flu, a serious disease that causes huge economic losses and human deaths. We ask Allah Almighty that it will not become a global pandemic.",
    "Answer": "It is known in Islamic law that the meat of animals that are permissible for consumption such as camels, cows, sheep, rabbits and poultry such as hens, ducks, geese and so forth, is not lawful unless they are slaughtered according to the principles laid down by Islamic law. These prescribed methods are the basis for the permissibility of consuming the meat of land animals which can be controlled during slaughter. Uncontrolled animals are to be slaughtered by felling them by injuring, hunting or spurring trained hunting animals to catch them. The meat of animals slaughtered by these methods is only lawful when undertaken by a Muslim, Christian or Jew. Islamic manner of slaughtering animals Slaughtering is performed by severing the animal's throat, i.e. the upper neck, which involves severing the windpipe [channel of breath], the gullet [channel of food] and the two blood vessels at either side of the neck. Slaughtering is lawful if these four vessels are severed, but if the slaughterer severs only the gullet and the windpipe, slaughtering is valid according to the preponderant opinion, since life usually does not continue afterwards. Nahr Nahr is performed by thrusting a knife in the animal's libba [the hollow between the two collarbones at the base of the neck] by which the four aforementioned vessels or the windpipe and the gullet are severed. In the well known opinion of the Maliki school, scholars maintained that nahr is achieved by fatally stabbing an animal in its libba with a knife without stipulating severing any of the four channels. This method is best reserved for slaughtering camels and other long necked animals that are lawful for consumption while cutting across the throat should be reserved for short necked animals such as cows, sheep and so forth. However, since both of these methods are sanctioned by Islamic law, they are substitutable. The evidence for this is the hadith that states: \"Slaughtering is by cutting across the throat or thrusting an animal in its libba\" [Reported by al-Darqatni in his Sunan (vol. 4, p.283) from the hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah. This hadith was also mentioned by al-Bukhari in his Sahih (the Book of sacrifices and Hunting, the section on Slaughtering) from a raised chain report narrated by Ibn 'Abbas [may Allah be pleased with them both]. `Aqr'Aqr, or what is known as necessity slaughtering, is performed by fatally wounding the animal on any part of its body. According to the unanimous opinion of scholars, this is the manner of slaughter that becomes necessary if the animal tries to escape and its owner is unable to control it. There is a scholarly agreement that this is likewise the manner used for game animals but not for those that can be controlled.Who is to perform slaughtering?It is unlawful to eat from the meat of an animal slaughtered by other than a Muslim, Christian or Jew because it is considered the meat of an unslaughtered dead animal. The RulingBased on the above, there is no objection to slaughtering chickens in the manner described in the question while following the above mentioned conditions. Rather, this method must be implemented if it protects against this deadly disease and due to the prohibition of killing and harming an individual."

    "Question": "Assalaamu alaikum!",
    "Answer": "Circumcision is a Sunnah for whoever embraces Islam. However, according to the opinion of the scholars who maintain its recommendation, circumcision is not considered a Sunnah if the person fears harm. Even the scholars who maintain its obligatoriness opine that it is impermissible to conduct the procedure if there is fear of harm. In such a case, circumcision must be delayed until the safety of the person is guaranteed since there is no worship in matters which may result in harm. And if some obligations are waived due to fear of incurring harm, then it is of greater precedence to waive recommended matters in similar cases as per the words of God Almighty, \"And do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction.\" [Al-Baqarah, 195]"

    "Question": "Is it permissible to elect a non believer who issues laws against the Islamic Shari’ah in a non Muslim country?",
    "Answer": "It is widely known in Islamic Shari’ah that providing benefits and interests and preventing what causes calamities and mischief is part and parcel of the major objectives of the Islamic Shari’ah. Imam al Ghazali in his book (al Mustasfa) defined interest in its original state as bringing goodness and preventing harm which is related to creation and people’s objectives in seeking their best interest. As in Islam, interest is tailored to preserve the five major objectives of Shari’ah which are designed to cater for people’s needs. The five major objectives of Shari’ah to serve creation are meant to preserve their lives, religion, mind, dignity and possessions. Therefore whatever entails preserving these five major objectives is considered an interest and whatever prevents the accomplishment of these five objectives is a harm that should be removed.As for non Muslim countries, it is known that they are ruled with civil and conventional laws which adopt a philosophy that is solely concerned with worldly benefits. These human made laws which are passed and issued through the legislative branch of the state can work either for or against the benefits of the Muslims. Therefore participating in electing a political party which has an agenda that serves the interests of Muslims could be considered a way of bringing benefits and preventing harm. Thus the Muslim who has the right of citizenship in a non Muslim country has the right to participate in political elections should these elections work out in the best interest of the Muslims such as presenting a positive image on Islam, defending the rights and issues that are pertinent to Muslims, seeking interest of religious minorities and strengthen their political participation and social activism, and conveying the needs and requests of Muslims to the political decision makers to put the Muslims’ demands into consideration.Sheikh Ibn Taymiyah in his book (al Istiqamah) said that the general ruling is if a matter would bring less benefit and more corruption, then it is deemed a prohibited matter. Therefore this political participation needs to be weighted in terms of benefits and harm. Also the issued fatwas on this realm differ based on differences in people, circumstances, places and times."

    "Question": "A man passed away and was survived by two wives and children from his first wife with no children from his second wife. After he died, Social Security issued a three month's pay in burial benefits in his second wife's name, totaling 5, 850 L.E (he was on pension). His second wife does not reside in the same place where he died and she did not share in any of the funeral expenses. As the children of the deceased covered all the costs of his funeral and burial, are they legally entitled to a share in this",
    "Answer": "Burial benefits are not among the things that can be inherited because they are not an established right owed by Social Security, but are considered a moral and monetary assistance to the heirs of the deceased. The sum is not fixed but is determined based on certain considerations and provisions established by social security. Due to this, the sum mentioned in the question is not subject to the rulings of inheritance, but belongs to the person in whose name the check was issued. However, the children who paid for their father's funeral expenses are entitled to ask his second wife for recompense.

    "Answer": "Whenever possible, money donated to a particular beneficiary such as a mosque, hospital or school must be spent on the entity stipulated by the donors. Any remaining money or money in surplus of the needs of the beneficiary must be given to a similar entity to achieve the aim of the donors. Since the collector, whether an individual or legal entity, is considered an agent of the donors, it is impermissible to deviate from the object of the commissioner. But if the contribution was not designated for a specific body and was meant for diverse charitable acts or an undesignated ongoing charity, it is then permissible to use the surplus money for a new charity project.The ruling Based on the above, if the money was collected for the benefit of the established mosque or by reason of it being a mosque, then it is necessary to spend the surplus money to build a minaret for it, expand it or to build another mosque. However, it would be impermissible to use it to build a hospital with the money.

    "Answer": "According to the Malikis and some Hanbalis, it is permissible to give zakat to those who wish to marry but have no means. They said that this includes giving sufficient financial aid from zakat funds to assist such a person if he does not have a wife and needs to marry )Hasheyat al-Rawd al-Murabba', 1/400).The Maliki scholar, Imam al-Hattab, said: \"Al-Burzuli mentioned that an orphan girl is given the expenses of her marriage needs from zakat funds. Based on this, it is a priority that a girl who does not have the articles and jewelry that are necessary for marriage to be given [financial aid] from zakat funds\" (Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil, 2/347).It has been reported that `Umar ibn Abdul-Aziz instructed one of his officials to call upon the people and ask: \"Where are the poor? Where are the indebted? Where are those who wish to marry?\" He wanted to give them money from the Muslim public treasury.Zakat is only obligatory upon Muslims because it is taken from their rich and given to their poor.The principle regarding zakat upon money is that it be paid in cash. However, since the aim of zakat is to benefit the recipient, there is no harm in giving it out as material goods if he is in need of them.The RulingIt is permissible to give zakat upon money in cash to those who wish to marry but do not have the means to do so. It is likewise permissible to give it out as material goods if this fulfills the recipient’s needs.And God Almighty knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/4870/what-is-the-ruling-of-sitting-in-mourning-and-reciting-qur’an-over-the-dead-at-a",
    "Question": "What is the ruling of sitting in mourning and reciting Qur’an over the dead at a wake?",
    "Answer": "Al-Ta’ziyah (mourning) has the linguistic meaning of one who has been afflicted having patience, and this is the meaning that is used by the jurists. Al-Nawawi said, “It is the order to have patience, to bear it for the promise of reward, cautioning against sin, and praying for forgiveness for the deceased and for the righting of the calamity for those suffering.” There is no difference of opinion among the jurists concerning the well-liked nature of mourning when one is befallen with calamity. The evidence for its well-liked nature is the saying of the Prophet, “Whoever pays their respects to one afflicted has a reward similar to theirs;” and his saying, “There is not a believer who pays his respects to his brother in affliction but that God clothes him in the finery of generosity on the Day of Resurrectiuon.” The jurists have differed concerning the family of the deceased sitting in one place to receive mourners. Some of them have deemed it disliked due to what it comprises of inciting and reminding people of sorrow, while others have deemed it permissible. Sheikh Muhammad ibn Muhammad known as al-Hutab, one of the imams of the Maliki schools, said, “…Sanad said, ‘It is permissible for a man to sit for mourning. A’ishah said, ‘When Zayd ibn Harithah, Ja’far ibn Abi Talib, and ‘Abdullah ibn Rawahah were killed, the Prophet sat in the mosque and sadness was apparent on his face.’ ’” The hadith of A’ishah that al-Hutab the Maliki used as evidence has been used by some scholars as eveidence for the permissibility of sitting in mourning whether it be in a mosque or in another place.Ibn ‘Abdin the Hanafi muhaqiq said, “(His saying, ‘By sitting here’) meaning in mourning. Its use in its actual meaning here is fine because it is in opposition to what is better as has been stated in Sharh al-Munyah. In al-ahkam ‘an khazanah al-fatawa [it says], ‘There is a license for men to sit for three days due to an affliction, but women should not sit at all.’ Then it said, ‘But in al-Dhahiriyah it says ‘It is alright for the deceased family [to do so] in their home or in the mosque while people come and pay their respects to them.’” Based on the preceding, it is our opinion that there is nothing wrong with sitting in mourning with the Qur’an being recited, regardless of whether it is at home or in a mosque, with the condition that it does not promote grief, annoy the neighbors with the volume of the recitation, or infringe on the public thoroughfare by erecting tents that make it hard for people to pass, for all of these things are impermissible since they include an infringement on the rights of others. If these things are avoided, then it is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it. And God is Most High and Knows best."

    "Id": 5840,
    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5840/what-is-the-ruling-for-a-muslim-entering-into-a-sufi-order",
    "Question": "What is the ruling for a Muslim entering into a Sufi Order? Why are their numerous Orders? If Sufism is asceticism, invocation, and traveling the path to God is it not enough for a Muslim to suffice with the Qur’an and the sunnah as a manual for spiritual growth?",
    "Answer": "Sufism is the system of spiritual growth and the acquiring good character which leads a Muslim to the level of perfection (ihsan) which the Messenger of God described as “worshiping God as if you see Him, for if you do not see Him, know that He sees you.” Therefore Sufism is a program of growth which concerns itself with purifying the self of all its diseases which prevent one from reaching God, and it seeks to rectify the crookedness of man’s self as it relates to God, others, and to one’ self.The Sufi Order is the body that takes care of this self purification and rectification, and the Sufi Sheikh is the person who provides the necessary training for those seeking to be with God.The human self by its nature accumulates diseases such as arrogance, haughtiness, self- praise, selfishness, stinginess, anger, ostentation, leanings towards sinful acts, revenge, hatred, loathing, trickery, and greed. God says, “I do not blame myself. Lo! the (human) soul enjoins unto evil, save he who my Lord has mercy. Lo! my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful”. For this reason our ancestors were cognizant of the importance of a spiritual discipline that could rid the self of its diseases, be in harmony with society, and ultimately be successful in leading one to God.To maintain orthodoxy Sufi Orders must contain certain characteristics such as strict adherence to the Qur’an and sunnah as Sufism is nothing more than the actualization of the Quran and sunnah. Anything that is against both the Quran and sunnah is not something that is a part or can be a part of Sufism. Another trait is that Sufism cannot see itself as separate from Shari‘ah knowledge; rather it is its essence. Sufism has three principles which are drawn from the Qur’an and sunnah; concern for the human self: “And a soul and Him Who perfected it. And inspired it (with conscience of) what is wrong for it and (what is) right for it. He is indeed successful who causes it to grow. And he is indeed a failure who stunts it” , an abundance of invocation: “O you who believe! Remember God with much remembrance” the Messenger of God said, “let your tongue be moist with the remembrance of God” , and finally renunciation of this world and a desire for the hereafter: “Naught is the life of the world save a pastime and a spot. Better far is the abode of the Hereafter for those who keep their duty (to God). Have ye then no sense?” As for the role of the Sheikh whom the sufi takes litanies from and whom guides them through the process of removing diseases from their hearts, he is the one who finds the most suitable program for each of his disciples (murids) as was the practice of the Prophet who used to give advice to people as to what would draw them near to God based on their psychosomatic makeup.For example a man came to the Messenger of God and said, “tell me of that which will keep me away from the wrath of God” and he said, “do not become angry” and another person came and asked, “give me something to cling to” and he replied, “let your tongue be moist with the remembrance of God”. There were those amongst the companions who increased their night prayer, others who read the Quran often, others participated in jihad often, others invoked often, and still others who gave charity often. This does not necessitate leaving certain matters of the religion. Rather, there are some acts of worship that a traveler on the path to God increases to help him reach his goal. It is for this reason that there are many doors to paradise, but there is still only one paradise. The Prophet, “For every people of a certain righteous act there is a door from the many doors of paradise that call those people, and for those who fast there is a special door that is called al-rayyan.” For this reason Sufi Orders have different methods of spiritual discipline depending on the specific Sheikh and disciple.From the above discussion it is clear what true Sufism is, what the real path to God is as well as who a true Sheikh is; the one who adheres to the Qur‘an and Sunnah. We have also learned the reasoning behind the various Orders whereas the reality of them is one. We should also mention that this above description does not apply to many of those who call to the way of Sufism today who in reality distort the realities of the path. We find many who have no religiosity, no piety such as those who dance lewdly at different occasions and who also act as those who are entranced but are nothing but mere pretenders. This is not of the matter of Sufism and we should not formulate our opinion of Sufism based on this. Those amongst the scholars who understand and practice Sufism should come together and explain these issues further to help the masses understand truth from falsehood.There is one matter left to be discussed; taking one’s spiritual methodology directly from the Qur‘an and sunnah. This is a statement that outwardly seems to be logical, but in reality it can bring destruction. We have not learned prayer and its conditions by reading the Qur‘an and sunnah. Rather, we learned prayer from a science called fiqh (jurisprudence) that was developed by the jurists who derived rulings which constitute the corpus of Islamic law based on the Qur‘an and sunnah using many tools codified in the science of juristic methodology (‘ilm usul al-fiqh). There has never been any person who was able to read the Qur‘an and sunnah and directly create law. There are also matters not covered by the Qur‘an and sunnah, especially in the science of Sufism, which makes it necessary to learn them from a qualified Sheikh and his teachings. These matters cannot be placed in books like the rules of Quranic recitation. The science of Sufism has been codified since the time of al-Junayd in the 4th Islamic century. As time went on and social conditions worsened so did some of the Sufi Orders that held on to outward appearances that contravened the Qur‘an and sunnah. Despite this, God will continue to protect and preserve Sufism as it is the true path to Him, “Lo! God defends those who are true. Lo! God loves not each treacherous ingrate”. From this above discussion the different parts of the question have been addressed, and we ask God to give us insight into His religion and He is most high and all knowledgeable."

    "Question": "Is the head of Sayyidna al-Husayn really at his shrine in Cairo?",
    "Answer": "The issue of the burial of the head of Sayyidna al-Husayn in Cairo is a historical question, not a legal question. This means that it is not necessary for people to believe it, so there are no consequences of belief or disbelief for denying it. For example, if someone were to say that the pyramids are not in Egypt and that they were really in some other country, would they be a disbeliever because of it? Certainly not, they would just be ignorant of the truth.The historians and authors of biographies are in agreement that the body of al-Husayn is buried in Karbala. As for his head, it was carried around until it was placed in Asqalan, a Palestinian port on the Mediteranean near ports of Egypt and Jerusalem. The presence of al-Husayn’s head in Asqalan and its being transported to Egypt is supported by a great number of historians including Ibn Maysar, al-Qalqashandi, Ali ibn Abu Bakr who is known as al-Sayih al-Harawi, Ibn Iyas, Sibt al-Juzi, and al-Hafidh al-Sakhawi.The historian al-Maqrizi says, “The head of Sayyidna al-Husayn was transported to Cairo from Asqalan on Sunday the eighth of Jumadi al-Akhir 548 H. (August 31st 1153 C.E.). The person who brought the head from Asqalan was Prince Sayf al-Mamlaka Tamim Waliha. It was brought to the palace on Tuesday the tenth of Jumadi al-Akhir (September 2nd 1153 C.E.).” He added, “The head was brought forth by al-Ustadh Maknun in an ‘ashari min ‘asharat al-khidmah. He brought it to al-Kafuri, then it was carried in a cellar (sardab) to the palace of al-Zumrud, then it was buried in the dome of al-Daylam by Bab Dahliz al-Khidmah.” Then he said, “Tala'a’ build a mosque for the head outside of Bab Zawaylah on the side of al-Darb al-Ahmar and it is known as the mosque of al-Salih Tala’a’. They washed the head in the mosque on wooden boards and it is said that they are still in the mosque.” Those who specialize in the field of artifacts have confirmed this. ‘Atiyat al-Shatwa, who was the artifacts inspector and who oversaw the renovation of the dome some a few years ago said, “Documents in the possession of the Bureau of Artifacts confirm that the head of al-Husayn was transported to Cairo from Asqalan, as is stated by al-Maqrizi, on Sunday the eighth of Jumadi al-Akhir 548 H. (August 31st 1153 C.E.), and the person who brought the head from Asqalan was Prince Sayf al-Mamlaka Tamim Waliha. It was brought to the palace on Tuesday the tenth of Jumadi al-Akhir (September 2nd 1153 C.E.).” Researchers at the British Library in London acquired a copy of a manuscript from Tarikh Amad by Ibn al-Awraq who died in 572 H. The Manuscript was written in 560 H, and it is catalogued under the number 5803 East. The author of this work established with certainty that the head of al-Husayn was brought to Cairo from Asqalan in 549 H, during the lifetime of the author himself, in his presence participating with the people of Egypt in greeting the noble head.Al-Shabrawi, the past Sheikh of al-Azhar, wrote a book entitled al-Ithaf in which he definitively establishes that the head is in its well-known resting place in Cairo. He mentions that among those who have established this are al-Imam al-Mundhari, al-Hafidh Ibn Dahyah, al-Hafidh Najm al-Din al-Ghayti, al-Imam Majd al-Din ibn Uthman, al-Imam Muhammad ibn Bashir, al-Qadi Muhyi al-Din ibn ‘Abd al-Dhahir, al-Qadi ‘Abd al-Rahim, ‘Abd Allah al-Rifa’i al-Makhzumi; Ibn al-Nahwi, al-Sheikh al-Qurashi, al-Sheikh al-Shiblinji, al-Sheikh Hasan al-‘Adawi, al-Sheikh al-Sha’rani, al-Sheikh al-Manawi, al-Sheikh al-Ajhuri, Abu al-Mawahib al-Tunsi, and others.Sheikh Muhammad Zaki al-Din Ibrahim composed a treatise on this subject called Ra’s al-Imam al-Husayn bi Mashhadihi bi al-Qahirah Tahqiqan Mu’aqidan Hasiman, which is full of evidence and proofs that satisfy the heart.From this presentation one’s heart may be at ease in that which most of the historians have said concerning the head of Imam al-Husayn honoring Cairo the Protected. And all praise is to God, Lord of the Worlds. And God is Most High and knows best."

    "Question": "My client's father endowed a parcel of farmable land and stipulated that its proceeds be directed towards the family mosque to cover any expenses and repairs and the wages of the mosque imam. The land is to be cultivated by the endowment's administrator, my client's husband. The mosque later came under the administration and supervision of the Ministry of Religious Trust. Since the family is wealthy and capable of covering any expenses needed by the mosque, is it permissible to direct the proceeds of the land to any charity or orphanage?",

It is impermissible to deviate from the condition laid down by the endower since the mosque, which is the beneficiary, is extant.The ruling Based on the above, it is impermissible to deviate from the condition laid by your client's father; the fact that the mosque is under the administration of the Ministry of Religious Trusts does not preclude fulfilling the endower's condition and the family's wealth has no bearing on the execution of the endower's condition."

The problem is that part of my parents’ money comes of interest. What does the Hanafi school of jurisprudence say about benefitting from my parents’ money?",
    "Answer": "It is permissible for Muslims to accept the gifts of non-Muslims and the permissibility of gift exchange between Muslims and non-Muslims was mentioned in various prophetic traditions. Al-Bukhari recorded that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) offered a garment to ‘Umar Ibn al- Khattab to give it as a gift to his non-Muslim brother.As for the opinion of Hanafi scholars on this matter, the Hanafi school permits Muslims to engage in corrupt contracts in non-Muslim countries. Their opinion is based on numerous evidences, one of which is the practice of usury by Ibn ‘Abbas in Makkah and the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not deem it impermissible before the conquest of Makkah. Consequently, it is permissible for you to benefit from your parents’ money.On a final note, we would like to advice you that part of being grateful to God for guiding you to Islam is to show kindness to your parents and giving them loving care.

    "Question": "Is banking interests for accounts is Halal or not.. if so which type is halal?",
    "Answer": "Since the emergence of banks in the modern age, jurists have disagreed on how they conceive the nature of banks. Their differences parallel the disagreement between scholars of conventional law and economists over whether the relationship between banks and their clients is one of lending (held by scholars of conventional law), or one of investment (held by economists). Built upon this difference in conception (Ar. taswir) is of difference in legal formulation (Ar. takyif). The jurists who consider this relationship to be financial lending formulate it as a loan which has brought benefit to the lender. Thus, its ruling would be based on it being unlawful usury. But then the fatwa differed, because some considered this a matter of necessities that are permissible for a Muslim to undertake whenever he is forced to, and is thus based upon the principle of ‘Necessities render the forbidden permissible’, which [in turn] is deduced from the all-encompassing words of God: But if anyone is forced to eat such things by hunger, rather than desire or excess, he commits no sin. [2:173]Other jurists maintain that this does not fall under the heading of necessities since necessity is legally defined as ‘something without which one would perish or come close to perishing’. Some of the jurists amongst this group maintain that it is permissible, based upon the principle of need being given the status of necessities - whether those needs are common or individual. As for the jurists who followed the formulation that the relationship between banks and clients is a relationship based upon investment: some of them consider it an invalid profit sharing venture [mudarabah] that can be rectified by combining it with a lease. Other members of this group maintain that it is a new transaction and a new type of contract which has no name in traditional Islamic law. Thus, they studied the matter in depth, just as the legists of Samarqand researched bay‘ al-wafa’ out of considering it a new type of contract. Likewise, the Shaykh al-Islam Abu al-Su‘ud researched ‘aqd al-mu‘amalah and ruled in favor of its lawfulness – just as the former scholars ruled with the lawfulness of bay‘ al-wafa’.They arrived at this judgment because they took into account the interests of the people and their dire need for these types of contracts; and because it was a means for market reform, and the masses depended on them for their livelihood. Moreover, it suited the demands of the age’s [new] developments in transportation and communication, and modern technology; population growth; weakened social relations; the development of accounting sciences and book-keeping; and separation between legal entities [e.g. corporations] and individuals, and many other [novel matters]. In brief, there is a difference of opinion concerning the issue of working in bank transactions and transacting with banks: how it is conceived and formulated, and its legal ruling in theory and in application. The established legal maxims are: Objection is reserved for omitting what is agreed to be a requirement, and performing something that is agreed to be unlawful. Objection is not for issues where there is a difference of opinion. It is recommended to remove oneself from controversial issues. Whoever is afflicted with something controversial must follow the opinion of those who permit it. It is necessarily known in Islam that usury is prohibited. This is because its prohibition has been stated explicitly in the Qur’an and Prophetic hadith, and because of the unanimous consensus of the Muslim community. God the Almighty says: But those who take usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by Satan’s touch. That is because they say, ‘Trade and usury are the same,' but God has allowed trade and forbidden usury. Whoever, on receiving God’s warning, stops taking usury may keep his past gains—God will be his judge—but whoever goes back to usury will be an inhabitant of the Fire, there to remain. [2:275]The Messenger of God said: God curses those who take usury, those who give it, those who witness it, and those who record it. [Bukhari and Muslim]However, the controversy revolves around the true nature of what is derived from banks: whether it is an instance of usury (which is unlawful) or invalid contracts (which are unlawful); or a new form of contract which would be permissible if it achieves the interests of the parties involved and is free of anything which is legally prohibited. Based on the above, every Muslim must realize that God the Almighty prohibited usury and that there is unanimous consensus concerning its prohibition. He must realize that concerning bank transactions, scholars [in all parts of] the world differ in conceiving, formulating, and arriving at its legal status in theory and in application. He must also realize that it is recommended to remove oneself from controversial issues. Nonetheless, he may follow those who permit it; in such a case, there is no prohibition involved in any form of banking activity: depositing or borrowing money, working in or transacting with them, and so forth."

    "Answer": "Yes, this is permissible in Islamic law. This is because it is considered a form of Murabaha.Murabaha is a sale in which it is permissible to stipulate an increase in price in exchange for deferring payment.Even though deferment is not considered real currency, in murabaha, there is an increase in price for deferment. The objective is to conclude the sale when there is an agreement between the two parties, there is no objection to the sale and people, buyers and sellers, are in need of it.This form of transaction is not considered riba [usury] according to the legal maxim:When the commodity comes between two transactions, there is no riba.God Almighty knows best.

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5851/can-insurance-be-islamic",
    "Question": "Can insurance be Islamic?",
    "Answer": "Since insurance in its various forms is a novel transaction which the Shari‘a [Islamic law] has not provided specific evidence concerning their legality or lack thereof – in this respect it is like bank transactions – engaging in it falls under the judgment of scholars and their research deduced from the general meaning of textual evidence, such as God Most High saying, “Assist one another in piety and being mindful of God, but do not assist one another in sin and enmity. Be mindful of God; indeed, God punishes severely” [5:2]. The Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “The example of believers in their love, sympathy, and compassion for one another is similar to the example of a single body: when a single part complains it calls upon the others vigilance and for defense”. And there are numerous other texts on this topic. Scholars have two opinions on the permissibility of Insurance:- One group of scholars considers it an unlawful transaction because of its inherent risk, gambling, betting, and unlawful increase [riba]. - The other group considers it permissible since it stands upon a foundation of social responsibility and assisting one another in acts of piety, and at its root is voluntary charity – not compensation. They are not among the contracts unlawful due to inherent risk since it is a contract to give voluntarily. It is not a contract for exchange – and thus nullified by risk – since its risk does not lead to disputes between the various parties because people make frequent use of it.Furthermore, it is widespread amongst the masses, spreading to all facets of their economic activities. And what people hold good and consent to without it leading to dispute is not forbidden. It is established in the Shari'ah that voluntary charity contracts can involve much risk, unlike exchange contracts such as buying and selling should not involve risk. -The legal maxims maintained in such disputable matters are:1. Objection is reserved for omitting what is agreed to be a requirement, and performing something that is agreed to be unlawful. Objection is not for issues where there is a difference of opinion. 2. It is recommended to remove oneself from controversial issues. 3. Whoever is afflicted with something controversial must follow the opinion of those who permit it. Based on the above, there is no objection in entering into insurance contracts and following the opinion of those who permit it. It is preferable to avoid it as a means of piety. However, it is not permissible for any of the two groups to deny the act of the other as long as it is a disputable matter. God Almighty knows best"

The purpose of this endowment is to spend from its proceeds on education expenditures, lodgings, educational tools and uniforms of the students. The institute offers free board and education.",
    "Answer": "Maliki scholars cited in their books the permissibility of cash endowments. Al-Kharshi says in Mukhtasar Khalil: \"The stance of the school is the permissibility of making endowments of unidentifiable property such as foodstuff and currency as expressed by the words of al-Shamel who, after citing scholarly opinions on its permissibility, cited opinions on their dislike and on their forbiddance stating that the latter are the weakest opinions. Their validity is evidenced by the words of the author in the chapter on zakat: 'Zakat is paid on a property and its financial proceeds were pledged as an endowment for lending people.' \" Al-Shaykh Ali ibn Ahmed al-Sidi al-'Adawi said in his commentary on Khalil: \"Cash money is permissible to be settled as endowments for lending people and for other purposes.\"It is known that the aim of Islamic law in regards to endowments, is the retention of property by suspending disposal of it and the perpetuity of its benefit for as long as possible. The Malikis found certain benefits in establishing cash endowments. They argued that because the sum itself is legally retained, it is permissible to establish cash endowment for lending since the endowment is legally existent although the property is not physically present. Citing al-Laqani, Shaykh al-Sidi al-'Adawi said in his commentary on Khalil: \"An endowment is the retention of property that can be benefitted from while the property itself remains or does not, but is legally existent such as dirhams and dinars\" i.e money. Al-Dusuqi said in his commentary on Al-Sharh al-Kabir:\"The returned loans replace the endowed capital.\"If a modern jurist were to look into the concept of cash endowments and the channeling of their financial proceeds, he will notice the actualization of the reason the Malikis maintained their permissibility although they deemed them disliked. This stance of the Malikis may be due to the possibility that the borrowers might not return the loans. However, by observing the current stable and codified financial scene, we find that such endowments endure for up to fifty years or more, thereby realizing the relative retention required by Islamic law, allowing us to maintain their permissibility and channeling their proceeds which are the subject of the question."

    "Question": "What is the ruling on the stipulation of receiving the price for exchanging old or used gold for new gold?Is it a condition for the seller to receive the price of the old gold from the merchant before purchasing new gold and paying for its price?",
    "Answer": "The Prophet forbade selling gold for gold and silver for silver for deferred payment (al-nasi`a) or an excessive difference in weight (al-fadl). This was mentioned in several ahadith among which is the report narrated by Sa'id al-Khudri and others in which the Prophet said, \"Do not sell gold for gold except for like for like and do not sell silver for silver except for like for like. Do not increase one over the other and do not defer payment.\"[1] This is because the effective cause ('illah) for this prohibition is that these metals are utilized as monetary instruments. Gold and silver jewelryBecause they are manufactured, gold and silver jewelry are not considered mediums of exchange. Therefore, the effective cause that stipulates the condition of weight equivalency and hand-to-hand transaction and which necessitates the prohibition of selling on credit no longer applies.Theyare therefore like any other commodity wherein the value of craftsmanship (in this instance, the fashioning of jewelry from raw gold) is taken into account.It is known that a ruling revolves around the presence or absence of its cause. This is the opinion of Ibn Taimiya, his student Ibn al-Qayyim and others. It is likewise the opinion transmitted through Mu'awiya (may Allah be pleased with him) and the scholars of Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan. In addition, it is the position of Imam Malik and that mentioned by Ibn Qudama from Hanbali scholars who permitted paying for craftsmanship. People have put this opinion into practice as mentioned in Al-Insaf by al-Mawardi on the condition that it does not involve prohibited craftsmanship such as gold jewelry crafted specifically for men. It is prohibited for men to wear such jewelry without a dispensation.Ibn al-Qayim said in I'lam al-Muwaqi'in, \"Permissible jewelry becomes, by virtue of permissible craftsmanship, of the same class as clothing and commodities and not of the same class as gold and silver monetary instruments. It is for this reason that it is not zakatable. No usury is involved when commodities are exchanged for monetary instruments. Likewise no usury is involved when gold jewelry is exchanged for monetary instruments.By virtue of its craftsmanship, permissible gold jewelry has ceased to be a medium of exchange but has become a tradable object. Therefore, there is no sin in trading it against gold.\"The ruling Based on the above, there is no objection in Islamic law to exchanging old or used gold for new gold. It is not a condition to pay the price of old gold before paying for new gold; it suffices to pay the difference in price. This is because gold jewelry is no longer considered a medium of exchange. Due to its craftsmanship, it is considered like any other commodity which is lawful to be sold for an increase in price or for deferred payment.Allah the Almighty knows best.[1]Bukhari"

They drew up a tentative contract which included a provision stipulating the payment of the above mentioned sum in damages if either party defaults. They agreed that the buyer pay the rest of the price for the plot of land after a month. But, one week later, the purchaser retracted from the sale and the seller refused to give him back the sum he paid.",
    "Answer": "Some scholars permitted the inclusion of a liquidated damages clause and made effective its associated consequences. Opinion of Hanbali scholars They maintained the permissibility of a contractual provision stipulating that whoever buys an object, pays part of its price and defers the rest while the seller stipulates that, should the buyer defaults, he is entitled to the money paid in advance. They further stated that contractual provisions stipulated by either party are permissible in their school except those which make something prohibited lawful or what make something lawful prohibited and what has been specifically prohibited by Islamic law. The provision mentioned in the question is not prohibited and is permissible as long as it does not make lawful what is prohibited and does not prohibit what is lawful. Al-Hattab, the Maliki scholar, mentioned in Iltizamat that the provision a wife includes in the marriage contract to the effect that her husband is to pay her a certain sum of money if he takes a second wife, is valid and he must fulfill it. This clearly demonstrates the permissibility of stipulations made for damages and the obligation of the defaulting party to fulfill it. The ruling The provision mentioned in the question does not contain anything that contravenes Islamic law and the sum mentioned in the clause does not contain jahalah [ignorance] that can affect the validity of the contract. The provision is acknowledged by Hanbali scholars whose opinion we choose for fatwa due to the necessity of conducting transactions, customs and to prevent harm. And since the buyer withdrew from the sale, the seller is entitled to the amount of liquidated damages contained in the contract."

    "Question": "A man passed away and was survived by his wife, mother and son. He was indebted with farmable lands. Is the debt to be deducted before or after the estate's division and is it to be settled from the share of a particular heir?",
    "Answer": "The rights associated with the estate of a deceased are as follows in their order of precedence:- Shrouding and burying the deceased without any stinginess or extravagance;- Settling any debts he might owe;- Executing any bequests from one third of the estate after the deduction of any debts;- Distributing the rest of the estate proportionally among the heirs.Since the deceased had incurred a debt during his lifetime and passed away without settling it, it is therefore mandatory to settle this debt from his estate after shrouding and burying him even if the debt exhausts the entire estate. The debt must be settled before the division of the estate among the heirs.The rulingIf the entire estate or part of it was distributed before settling the debt, then the debt must be deducted proportionately from the share of each heir.

    "Question": "Is it permissible to rent fruit trees and paying the rent in advance?",
    "Answer": "The Hanbali scholars, Harb al-Karamani and abu al-Wafa` ibn 'Uqail maintain the permissibility of renting trees and this is likewise the opinion chosen by Imam ibn Taymiyyah. They base their opinion on Sa'id ibn Mansur's report which states:\"'Usayd ibn Hudayr passed away while he was indebted with six thousand dirhams. So 'Umar called his creditors and rented out to them Usayd's land which included palms and other trees for several years.\" This corresponds to the permissibility of renting land for cultivation, hiring a wet nurse and the like. Renting trees in this scenario is permissible because it generates benefits while the source itself remains (such as the fruits from trees and the wool from sheep) and is renewable by Allah.The RulingIt is permissible for the owner to follow this opinion due to the people's need for it i.e.renting the trees to those who will water and fertilize them, ward off any damage, and harvest the fruit for a determined period in exchange of a known fee. According to this opinion, renting trees does not fall under the Prophet's prohibition concerning selling unripe produce.Allah Almighty knows best"

    "Question": "We see a lot of students and adepts kissing the hands of their teachers and guides, is this permissible?",
    "Answer": "The ways that people honor those that have rights over them differ with the different cultural norms of a given people. We see, for example, that in the Arabian Peninsula they kiss their fathers on the nose as a way of honoring them, and they kiss the heads of their scholars. The original ruling of all of these things is that they are permissible so long as particular forms that Muslims may engage in have not been prohibited.As for the question of kissing the hands of scholars, it is permissible to do so with a scrupulous scholar, a just ruler, one’s parents, one’s teacher, and anyone who is worthy of being honored and respected. According to Ibn ‘Umar, he was in one of the Prophet’s raiding parties and in his narration he mentioned a story and said, “So we came to the Prophet and kissed his hand.” The schools of jurisprudence have come to a consensus that kissing the hand of a scholar who is righteous towards his religion is not prohibited saying that it is permitted and well-liked. The positions of the relied upon schools follow:The Hanafis explicitly stated that it is permissible to kiss the hand of a righteous scholar as a means of seeking blessings and honoring him. Al-Haskafi al-Hanafi said, “(There is nothing wrong with kissing the hand of) a man who is (a scholar) and one who is scrupulous as a means of seeking blessings. Durr. The author narated from al-Jami’ that there is nothing wrong with kissing the hand of a religious ruler (a just ruler).” Ibn Nujaym said, “There is nothing wrong with kissing the hand of a scholar and a just ruler based on the narration according to Sufyan who said, “Kissing the scholar’s and the just ruler’s hand is sunna.” Concerning kissing hands, al-Zayla’i mentioned the following, “When it is out of obedience and honoring [someone] it is permissible. Al-Shaykh, al-Imam, Shams al-aimah al-Sarakhsi and some of the later scholars allowed or gave license (rakhkhasa) for kissing the hand of a scholar or someone who is pious as a means of seeking blessings. Abu Bakr kissed the Prophet between his eyes after they were closed and Sufyan al-Thawri said, “Kissing the hand of a scholar or a just ruler is sunna,” and ‘Abd Allah ibn Mubarak rose and kissed his head.” Muhammad al-Babarti al-Hanafi said, “There is nothing wrong with it when it is out of obedience and honoring [someone] if they are wearing a shirt or a cloak [i.e. a garment symbolic of scholarship]. According to Sufyan, kissing the hand of a scholar is sunna, but license is not given for kissing someone else’s hand.” The Malikis: It has been related from Imam Malik that it is disliked, but the later scholars of the Maliki school are in agreement with the majority that it is permissible. They interpreted the position of it being disliked that was related from Imam Malik as referring to a situation in which it leads to arrogance. Al-Abhuri said, “The dislike of Malik is if it is out of aggrandizement and arrogance. Al-Nafrawi said, ‘An example of it is the kissing of the Bedouin who asked the Prophet sayin, ‘Show me a sign,’ So the Prophet said, ‘Go to that tree and tell it, ‘The Prophet calls you.’ The tree moved right and left and came towards the Prophet saying, ‘Peace be upon you Messenger of God.’ The Prophet told the Bedouin, ‘Tell it to return,’ and it returned as it had been. The Bedouin kissed the Prophet’s hands and feet and became a Muslim. And there are other similar narrations. If Malik’s denial of what is narrated concerning the kissing of hands is from the perspective of narration, Malik is a proof, for he is the Imam of hadith, and if it is from the perspective of jurisprudence, then it is due to what preceded. The actions of people are bases on the permissibility of kissing the hand of someone to whom it is permitted to be humble and to obey. The Companions kissed the hand of the Prophet, the Prophet kissed the hand of Fatimah, and the Companions kissed the hands of each other. The apparent meaning of his words is that even if it is the hand of a scholar, old person, ruler, father, someone present, or someone returning from travel, and that is the apparent (dhahir al-madhhab) position of the school.” The Shafi’is explicitly stated that kissing the hand of a pious scholar is well-liked, as is every kind of honor given to them or other persons of rank. Al-Nawawi said, “The chosen position is that it is well-liked to honor someone entering [a room] by standing if they have an external rank in knowledge, righteousness, honor, or authority accompanied by care, or if they have a sanctity through sainthood . This standing is in order to honor [them] and is not [a form of] ostentation or aggrandizement. The actions of the community, both its early and its later members, have been in accordance with this…It is well-liked to kiss the hand of a righteous man, an ascetic, or a scholar and the like from among the people of the afterlife. As for kissing someone’s hand because of their [monetary] wealth, their [command of the] world, their power, and the rank that they hold with people of the world for the world and the like, it is extremely disliked. Al-Mutawali said it is not permissible, indicating that it is prohibited. Kissing their head or feet is the same as kissing their hand.” Similar to this is what is mentioned by Sheikh al-Islam Zakariyah al-Ansari who said, “(It is well-liked to kiss the hand of a living person due to their righteousness and similar things) from religious matters like asceticism, knowledge, and honor as the Companions did with the Prophet, as is related by Abu Dawud and others with authentic chains of transmission. (This is disliked) kissing someone’s hand (when it is due to their wealth and the like) of worldly things, like their power or their rank among people of the world.” Ibn Qasim al-‘Ibadi said, “It is sunna to kiss the hand of a scholar, a righteous man, a member of the Prophet’s line, and an ascetic like the Companions did with the Prophet. This is disliked when it is for a rich person and the like. It is also well-liked to stand for people of rank as a way of honoring them, not as a form of ostentation or aggrandizement, i.e. pridefulness.” The Hanbalis explicitly stated that it is permissible to kiss the hand of a scholar and a ruler. The Hanbali muhaqiq Ibn Muflih said, “Kissing the hand of a scholar and a generous person because of their support, and a ruler because of his authority is permissible.” Al-Safarini said, “He said in Manaqib Ashab al-Hadith, ‘The student should have great humility for the scholar and humble himself before him.’ He said, ‘An aspect of humility is kissing his hand.’ Sufyan Ibn 'Uyaynah and al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyad, one of them kissed the hand and the other the foot of al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali al-Jufi. Imam Abu al-Ma’li said in his commentary on the Hidayah, ‘Kissing the hand of a scholar, a generous person because of their support, and a ruler because of their authority is permitted. As for kissing someone’s hand because of their wealth it is narrated that, ‘Whoever humbles themselves before a rich person because of their wealth has lost a third of their religion.’” From what has preceded it is clear that kissing the hands of scholars and those who have rights over us is well-liked and there is no cause to decry it. Verily there are egos that have grown haughty with pride and rejected that which goes against their pride, and God is Most High and Knows Best."

    "Question": "The inquirer works in a restaurant where customers usually tip though they are not obligated to do so. The owner of the restaurant collects all the tips intended for the staff. Please note that the customer would not leave a tip if he knew that the owner would take it. For this reason, some staff members resort to hiding the tips from the owner. Is this permissible?",
    "Answer": "God prohibited consuming another's property unlawfully and the Prophet (God’s peace and blessings upon him) demonstrated that a Muslim's property is sacred except with his consent. It is known that an employee, like his employer, is financially independent. The employee works for remuneration and the contract between him and his employer does not specify that he (the owner) take any money that his employees receive; theirs is not a master-slave relationship such that it can be said that the master is entitled to his slave's money. Rather, the employee must do his work and the owner must give him his salary. There is nothing to entitle the owner to take his staff's tips, which the customers consider a charity, zakat, or a gift. This is money gained unlawfully since the tip is intended for the staff and not the owner and since the customer would not be pleased if he learns that the owner took the tips for himself.By the same token, it is not permissible for the employee to take anything from the customer's check.The rulingIt is legally permissible for the employee to conceal any tips he receives if he fears that the restaurant owner will take them. It is impermissible for the owner to appropriate the tips as long as the customer or employee does not give them to him."

    "Question": "I am a Muslim girl living in Europe. I studied here and then started to search for a job but could not find a job that did not require me to take off my hijab. One month ago, I finally found a job that allows me to wear my hijab but requires me to mix with men. My husband says that It is not permissible in Islam for women to mix with men at work. What is the truth of this and would the money I receive as a salary be unlawful?",
    "Answer": "Muslims have always maintained that the mere presence of women in the same place as men is not prohibited in itself. The prohibition only concerns the manner of mixing when it contradicts the guidelines of Islamic law such as men and women exposing those parts of their bodies which must remain covered, males and females gathering for an unlawful purpose or an unlawful seclusion between the sexes [being alone together in a place where no one could have access to them] or touching.Evidence from the sunnaSahl ibn Sa'd al Sa'idy, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Abu Usayd invited the Prophet [pbuh] and his Companions to his wedding feast and his wife, Um Usayd, served them food and drink herself\" [Related by al-Bukhari and Muslim].Al Bukhari placed this hadith in a chapter which he entitled On [the permissibility] of a woman serving [food and drink to] men at her own wedding.Al Qurtuby stated in his exegesis of Qur'an: \"Our scholars said: The report demonstrates the permissibility of the bride serving [food and drink to] her husband and his friends at her wedding.\"Ibn Batal said in his explanation of Bukhari's collection of authentic hadith: \"Separating between men and women [when they are in the same place and in direct interactions] is not obligatory for Muslim women in general but was specific to the wives of the Prophet; Allah says:And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. [Qur'an 33: 53]Ibn Hajar, the scholar of hadith, said in his book Fath al Bari: \"The hadith demonstrates the permissibility of a woman serving [food and drink to] her husband and his guests. There is no doubt that this permissibility is valid only when the legal guidelines (lack of temptation and a woman covering what must be concealed) are met.\"The two foremost scholars in hadith, al-Bukhari and Muslim, mention a report about Abu Talha al-Ansari and his guest: Abu Talha and his wife invited a guest into their home. As they did not have enough food to go around, they pretended to eat, and spent the night hungry. In the scholar Ibn abu Dunya's version, Anas narrated that Abu Talha told his wife: 'Crumble the bread and put it in butter, and tell the servant to blow out the lamp.' Then they pretended to share the food with their guest.\" It is apparent from this report that they were all eating from the same dish. The Prophet [pbuh] told Abu Talha:\"Allah is pleased with what you did tonight.\" The following verse was sent addressing this event:They love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what the emigrants were given but give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation. [Qur'an 59: 9]Abu Juhaifa, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The Prophet [pbuh] established a bond of brotherhood between Salman and abu al Dard'a. Salman visited Abu al Dard'a and found his wife, Um al Dard'a disheveled. \"What's wrong?\" he asked her. She replied: \"Your brother, Abu al Dard'a, has no worldly desires…\"Commenting on this hadith, Ibn Hajar said: \"This hadith includes some benefits … the permissibility of talking to non-mahram women and asking about that which concerns their life.\"As for business affairs which require for men and women to remain in the same place, there is no legal impediment for them to be together should the atmosphere is secured from temptation and private seclusion. The mere existence of both men and women in the same place is not prohibited in itself as what is prohibited is the seclusion of man and woman in a locked place where no one can enter. Imam ibn Daqiq al ‘Eid said in his book (Ihkam al Ahkam Sharh ‘Umdat al Ahkam) in his commentary on the prophetic tradition in which the Prophet said “don’t enter on women”, ibn Daqiq said that this statement is meant to address men other than the non marriageable male relatives of the woman and the statement does not prohibit the general entrance of a room where there is a woman but rather prohibit entering a room on a woman when prohibited private seclusion with the woman is meant. Therefore if there is no prohibited private seclusion with a woman is meant, it is permissible for the man to enter a place where there is a woman.More importantly, not every seclusion is meant to be a prohibited seclusion as Bukhari and Muslim reported through the authority of Anas ibn Malik that a woman from the Ansar came to the Prophet so he sat alone with her and addressed her saying “by God you- the women of Ansar- are dear to my heart” and al Bukhari included this hadith under the chapter titled “Chapter on the permissibility of seclusion between a man and a woman when they are among people”. Al Hafiz ibn Hajar in his book (Fath al Bari) said that conversing with non mahram women secretly does not cause questioning one’s religiosity should there be no temptation. Mulla ‘Ali al Qari in his book “Mirqat al Mafatih” said that seclusion with a woman in the street is not the same as seclusion with a woman in a house. Sheikh al Shabramalsi al Shafi’i opined in his commentary on (Nihayat al Muhataj) that the prohibited private seclusion only occurs when the meeting of the two sexes is accompanied by a strong potential of temptation but if usually there is no room for temptation, seclusion is not prohibited.Therefore based on the above mentioned question, there is no legal impediment which prevents you from continuing your work and your financial compensation from it is not prohibited."

    "Id": 4866,
    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/4866/what-is-the-ruling-concerning-music",
    "Question": "What is the ruling concerning Music?",
    "Answer": "The word “music” comes from ancient Greece and is a reference to the “art of combining sounds in a certain order for aesthetic effect.” Music is also concerned with combining these sounds in a harmonic way; therefore it studies what sounds go together and what sounds do not. This is achieved both through musical instruments and through human voices.The issue of listing to music is one that has differing opinions in Islamic law, it is not from matters of creed or those matters that are necessarily known from religion therefore it is not prudent for Muslims to castigate one another on such issues since one can only castigate issues that are agreed upon, not issues that have differing opinions. As there are jurists who have ruled that listening to music is permissible and they are jurists whom it is permissible to follow in their scholarship, it is therefore impermissible for one to criminalize Muslims who follow such an opinion. This is even more so as there is no single text proof that specifically outlaws music.Among the scholars who have ruled music and listening to music is permissible is Imam al-Ghazali as he stated:Amusement and entertainment help one in seriousness and serious matters as one cannot tolerate such matters without aid, except for the Prophets upon them be peace. Therefore, amusement and entertainment are cures of the heart from exhaustion so it must accordingly be permissible, however one should not engage in it with excess just as one cannot take medicine in excess. Based on this intention (i.e. relaxation and aid in seriousness and serious matters) amusement and entertainment become acts of drawing near to God and this is for the person whom listening to music does not stir up a certain praiseworthy trait that he seeks to be evoked by listening to music, rather such a person only seeks pure enjoyment and relaxation so it is incumbent that such an act be praiseworthy for him to engage in so as to reach the goals mentioned previously. This situation, however, indicates a level lesser than wholeness as the whole person is he who is in no need of other than the truth to aid him. However, the righteous deeds of the common people are the misdeeds of those who are high in spiritual rank. Whosoever has mastered the science of the cures of the heart and the ways in which to make the heart soft knows with certainty that these sorts of entertainment and amusement are things one can not dispense with. Imam al-Ghazali has also written that “if musical instruments have become the sign of drunkards or lewdness, if the instruments are like the harmonica, wind instruments, string instruments, or drums used by drinkers then it is impermissible. And every other kind of instrument remains permissible such as tambourines even with jingles, drums, striking drums with branches, guitars and the like, or any other instrument.” Other scholars saw in music and listening to music lessons and allusions for those who understand and whose souls are at a high level. Amongst them was Qadi ‘Iyyad al-Shibli who was asked about listening to music to which he replied, “its apparent nature is seductive and tempting while esoterically it is full of lessons so whoever can understand the allusion it is permissible for them to listen to music.” Similar statements can be found attributed to the Sultan of the scholars al-‘Izz ibn ‘Abd al-Salam who said, “the path to rectifying hearts from without are many such as listening to Qur’an which is the best thing one can listen to, it can also be done to listening to admonishment and remindful talk, it can be done through songs and odes, and it can be done through music and instruments of which there is a difference of opinion regarding its permissibility. For example the flute, if listening to it is permissible then it is praiseworthy what occurs to a person when listening to it and has left cautiousness in religion by listening to that which has differing opinions regarding.” Al-Qurtubi has mentioned in his commentary on the Qur’an al-Jami al-Ahkam al-Quran the singing of some Qusharites in the presence of the Prophet the day he entered Madina. Abu Bakr was disturbed by this and the Prophet said, “leave them Abu Bakr so that the Jews can see that our way is expansive.” They were playing drums and saying, “we are the girls of al-Najjar and we love that Muhammad is a neighbor”. Al-Qurtubi then said, “it is said that the tambourine and other instruments used in weddings are permissible as long as what is said is sound and not from foulness.” Al-Shawkani has stated in his Nayl al-Awtar in the section “That which has come concerning instruments of amusement and music” both the arguments for those who rule on its impermissibility and permissibility. He specifically discussed the hadith in which the Prophet said, “Every form of amusement which the believer engages in is false except for three; a man being playful with his wife, a man being playful with his horse, and archery”. Al-Shawkani then quotes Imam al-Ghazali’s commentary on this hadith, “The Prophet’s statement ‘is fales’ does not necessitate its impermissibility, rather it indicates its lack of benefit”. Al-Shawkani then adds “this is indeed a sound statement since anything that has no direct benefit is from the category of permissible things.” Al-Shawkani offers other text proofs to the same effect such as the women who vowed to play the tambourine if the Prophet returned from a certain battle safely. When he did, he allowed her to carry out her vow without any form of castigation. This allowance indicates that what the women did was not an act of disobedience in such a circumstance.Ibn Hazm has stated that the Prophet said:“all actions are based on intentions and to every person is what they intended” thus whosoever listens to singing, or engages in any other act, as an aid in disobedience towards God then it is evildoing, and whosoever intends by listening to singing relaxation of one’s soul so as to aid it in being obedient to God and helping it perform righteous acts then he is engaging in an obedient act and is rewarded and this action is a true and sound one. Whosoever does not intend either disobedience or obedience, then this action is simple amusement and it is ineffectual and such an act is pardoned such as a person walking in his garden strolling or one sitting on his doorstep relaxing. In summary we can say that the issue of singing, with instruments and without, is an issue that has caused scholarly dispute throughout all ages. These scholars have agreed on aspects regarding the issues and have disagreed in other aspects. They have agreed that any sort of singing of music that causes disobedience or aids in disobedience is impermissible as singing is comprised of words so its good is permitted and its bad is impermissible. These scholars have also agreed on the permissibility of singing a cappella especially in times of happiness such as weddings, homecomings, and days of ‘Eid as long as certain conditions are met such as a woman does not sing in front of non-relative males. The areas of disagreement are whether musical instruments are permissible or not and others mentioned earlier.Based on this discussion we find that singing, whether with musical instruments or without, is permissible with the condition that it not a call for disobedience, lewdness, and does not contain any themes contrary to the Shari‘ah. It is also noteworthy that excess of music and singing can take the act beyond its permissibility to the category of reprehensible acts, and perhaps even to the category of impermissibility. God is most high and all knowledgeable."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/4867/singing",
    "Question": "What is the ruling concerning singing?",
    "Answer": "The nature of singing is in prolonging one’s voice and using different pitches whereby creating a certain sound. If it is done without musical instruments and the lyrics are within the confines of the Shari‘ah then there is nothing wrong with it. It is recommended that the words be praises of God, His Messenger (God’s peace and blessings upon him), ones that promote courage, love for homeland, and other related topics. There is no objection if the words are of a different nature but are still within the confines of the Shari‘ah.In certain instances singing is a necessary act to add to festiveness or relaxation such as during ‘Eid, weddings, homecomings, walimas, ‘aqiqas, and during birth. This permissibility has come to us by way of many texts among which are:1. ‘Aisha narrated that she attended a wedding of the Ansar and the Prophet (God’s peace and blessings upon him) said, “O ‘Aisha did they not have a form of entertainment since the Ansar enjoy entertainment?” 2. Ibn ‘Abbas said that ‘Aisha married off a family member to a man of the Ansar and the Prophet (God’s peace and blessings upon him) asked her, “Did you give the young girl a gift?” “Yes,” she replied. He then asked, “Did you send someone with her to sing?” “No,” she replied. So the Prophet said, “The Ansar are a people who enjoy celebration [by reciting] poetry, so send someone to recite ‘we have come to you, we have come to you, so greetings to you and greetings to us.’” 3. On the authority of ‘Aisha who said that Abu Bakr came in upon her during the days of ‘Eid al-Adha when there were two young slave girls with her singing and beating drums. The Messenger of God (God’s peace and blessings upon him) was covered by his garment and Abu Bakr reprimanded them. The Messenger of God uncovered himself and said, “Let them be Abu Bakr as these are days of festivities.” 4. ‘Aisha said, “I used to have a slave girl and I married her off one day. On the day of her wedding the Messenger of God came in and he did not hear any singing or form of playful enjoyment so he said, ‘O ‘Aisha did you sing for her or not?’ Then the Messenger of God said, ‘This group from the Ansar like singing.’” 5. On the authority of ‘Amir ibn S‘ad who said, “I was with Thabit ibn Wadi‘a and Qurtha ibn K‘ab in a wedding that had singing and I heard a sound so I asked them, ‘Will you not listen?’ They replied, ‘It has been prescribed as a dispensation to listen to singing during weddings.’’” 6. Umm Salama received a slave girl who belonged to Hassan ibn Thabit on the day of ‘Eid al-Fitr who came to sing her poetry with a drum. Umm Salama chastised her for this so the Messenger of God (God’s peace and blessings upon him) said, “Leave her O Umm Salama as every people have a day of festivity and this is our day of festivity.” 7. Rubi‘a bint Mu‘awith ibn ‘Afra’ narrated, “One day the Messenger of God (God’s peace and blessings upon him) came to me the morning after my wedding night and sat on a mat as you are sitting now (i.e. Khalid ibn Dhakwan who narrates this hadith from Rubi‘a). I made some slave girls beat the duff and they mourned by singing ‘whom from my fathers was killed on the day of Badr’ until they got to the line “and amongst us is a prophet who knows what tomorrow will bring” and the Messenger of God stopped them and said, ‘Leave this line and continue with what you were saying.’” 8. On the authority of ‘Aisha who said, “The Messenger of God (God’s peace and blessings upon him) was sitting and we heard a clamor so he rose and saw an Ethiopian girl dancing and boys were around her. He said ‘O ‘Aisha come and see.’ So I went and placed my chin on his shoulder and I watched what was in view between his head and shoulder. He then he asked, ‘Have you had enough?’ I kept saying no to him so I could know my real rank with him. Then ‘Umar came and the people started to scatter from around the Ethiopian and the Messenger of God said, ‘Indeed I can see the Satanic Jinns and people fleeing from ‘Umar.’ And then I left.” 9. From the traditions narrated by the companions is one by Zayd ibn Aslam who narrates on the authority of his father who said that once ‘Umar heard a woman singing and said, “Singing is from the provisions of the traveler.”There are those who have ruled that singing is prohibited even if it is not accompanied with instruments, however their text proofs are ultimately inconclusive. Qadi Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi stated in his book al-Ahkam, “Nothing concerning its prohibition (i.e. singing) is sound argument.” Imam al-Ghazali and Ibn al-Nahawi in his al-‘Umda maintained the same opinion. Ibn Tahir said, “Not one single letter of them [of the arguments stating the prohibition of singing] is correct. Ibn Hazm stated, “Everything related to this [the prohibition of singing] is falsehood and fabricated.”There is nothing negative in singing as it is amongst the beautiful things of life which the self and intellect find pleasing. It is also from our fitra (natural primordial state). Singing is from the enjoyment of sound as it is pleasing to the ears just as food is the enjoyment of the stomach and any beautiful sight is pleasing to the eye. Islam is a religion of beauty and comfort, and there is nothing good or beautiful except that Islam has made them permissible as a mercy from God towards this nation and people. God Most High says, “They ask you (O Muhammad) what is made lawful for them. Say: (all) good things are made lawful for you”. And God has not made it permissible for anyone to make prohibited those pleasant and beautiful things which He Alone has given as provision to us no matter how pure one’s intention is in doing this.Declaring things prohibited or permissible are from the authority of God Alone. He says, “Say: have you considered what provision God has sent down for you, how you have made of it lawful and unlawful? Has God permitted you, or do you invent a lie concerning God?”If we contemplate on the issue of singing, we can almost say that the enjoyment derived from singing and hearing it is a natural human trait. For example, a young baby is always comforted by the singing of its mother which is why mothers and wet nurses have throughout history always sung to their children. Even animals are comforted by singing of which Imam al-Ghazali wrote:Whomever is not moved when hearing singing, is lacking and leaning away from the middle way, he is away from spirituality, possessing an increase in roughness which forms a barrier between him and beauty, the birds, and the rest of the animals. The camel, even with its simple nature, is affected when one sings to it by making it tolerate heavy loads and long distances since its attention is captured by the singing, and a drive is created inside the camel that intoxicates and entertains it. When camels hear singing they stretch their necks and ears to listen to it, they even rush to the sound causing its load to sway back and forth.From the above discussion it is clear that singing is not prohibited except if it contains words that contradict the Shari‘ah. Singing is permissible and is even recommended if it contains praises of God, His Messenger, Islam, and love for homeland.And God is most High and Knowledgeable."

    "Question": "Is it permissible for a female to teach males the science of Qur`anic recitations and its related topics such as the [variant]recitations, Qur`anic orthography and classical religious books since there are no males specialized in this science in our area?",
    "Answer": "There is no legal objection to men teaching women or vice-versa. Muslims have always maintained that the mere presence of women in the same place as men is not prohibited in itself. The prohibition only concerns the manner of mixing when it contradicts the guidelines of Islamic law such as men and women exposing those parts of their bodies which must remain covered, males and females gathering for an unlawful purpose or an unlawful seclusion between the sexes [being alone together in a place where no one could have access to them] or touching. Evidence from the sunnaSahl ibn Sa'd al Sa'idy, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Abu Usayd invited the Prophet [pbuh] and his Companions to his wedding feast and his wife, Um Usayd, served them food and drink herself\" [Related by al-Bukhari and Muslim]. Al Bukhari placed this hadith in a chapter which he entitled On [the permissibility] of a woman serving [food and drink to] men at her own wedding. Al Qurtuby stated in his exegesis of Qur'an: \"Our scholars said: The report demonstrates the permissibility of the bride serving [food and drink to] her husband and his friends at her wedding.\" Ibn Batal said in his explanation of Bukhari's collection of authentic hadith: \"Separating between men and women [when they are in the same place and in direct interactions] is not obligatory for Muslim women in general but was specific to the wives of the Prophet; Allah says: And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. [Qur'an 33: 53] Ibn Hajar, the scholar of hadith, said in his book Fath al Bari: \"The hadith demonstrates the permissibility of a woman serving [food and drink to] her husband and his guests. There is no doubt that this permissibility is valid only when the legal guidelines (lack of temptation and a woman covering what must be concealed) are met.\" The two foremost scholars in hadith, al-Bukhari and Muslim, mention a report about Abu Talha al-Ansari and his guest: Abu Talha and his wife invited a guest into their home. As they did not have enough food to go around, they pretended to eat, and spent the night hungry. In the scholar Ibn abu Dunya's version, Anas narrated that Abu Talha told his wife: 'Crumble the bread and put it in butter, and tell the servant to blow out the lamp.' Then they pretended to share the food with their guest.\" It is apparent from this report that they were all eating from the same dish. The Prophet [pbuh] told Abu Talha:\"Allah is pleased with what you did tonight.\" The following verse was sent addressing this event: They love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what the emigrants were given but give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation. [Qur'an 59: 9] Abu Juhaifa, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The Prophet [pbuh] established a bond of brotherhood between Salman and abu al Dard'a. Salman visited Abu al Dard'a and found his wife, Um al Dard'a disheveled. \"What's wrong?\" he asked her. She replied: \"Your brother, Abu al Dard'a, has no worldly desires…\" Commenting on this hadith, Ibn Hajar said: \"This hadith includes some benefits … the permissibility of talking to non-mahram women and asking about that which concerns their life.\"Women teaching menThe Prophet's [pbuh] wives used to teach Islamic law and spread religion. This was mentioned in the books of Sunna as well as the fact that later generations of women delivered religious knowledge and men reported hadiths from them. In his book, Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani mentioned 1543 women from among female scholars, hadith narrators, and literary figures. Muslim women participated with men in public life while observing Islamic decorum. Some females from among the Companions of the Prophet [pbuh] were even in charge of looking after the morality of the city."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/4844/eating-out-at-mixed-gender-restaurants",
    "Question": "Is it permissible for a woman or a man to eat out at a restaurant where there is no gender segregation?",
    "Answer": "According to the practice of generations of Muslims from among the predecessors and successors, the mere presence of males and females in the same place is not prohibited in itself. Rather, the prohibition concerns the manner of their gathering if it contradicts the rulings of Islamic law. This includes, for example, women uncovering what they have been commanded to cover in Islamic law, gathering to commit an abominable act or sitting in unlawful privacy with the opposite sex. As for the prohibited mixing between the opposite sexes, it is that which involves touching and physical contact and not merely being present in the same place. Ibn Batal in his commentary on al Bukhari said that the separation between males and females in places and dealings is not an obligation on Muslim women as it is was only a commandment on the wives of the Prophet (God’s peace and blessings be upon him).In his commentary in Fath al Bari, al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said that it is permissible for a wife to serve her husband and those he invites over to his home should she keep her dignity intact through wearing her hijab. In case of jeopardizing her dignity in any way or form, it is deemed impermissible for the woman to be surrounded with men.In Sahih al Bukhari, it was narrated by Abu Juhaifah that the Prophet (God’s peace and blessings be upon him) made alliances of brotherhood among the emigrants (al Muhajireen) and the supporters (al Ansar). Once Salman went to visit Abu al Dardaa and he found his wife looking upset. When he asked her for the reason, she said, “Abu al Dardaa has no desire in this world.” From this narrative, we conclude the permissibility of conversing between opposite sexes.Therefore, we conclude that the sheer presence of men and women in one place does not render impermissibility as prohibition is only deemed relevant when the man and the woman seclude themselves in a place where no one can enter. In addition, the mere act of closing the door of an office or the like does not make it prohibited and is not considered an unlawful privacy because the door is not locked and anyone can easily go in and out of the room"

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/4845/is-it-permissible-for-an-unmarried-woman-adopt-a-child",
    "Question": "Does an unmarried woman have the right to adopt a child or children?",
    "Answer": "Islam encourages sponsoring orphans, rearing them, treating them kindly and seeing to their needs and interests to the extent that the Prophet (God’s peace and blessings be upon him) promised that the person who sponsors an orphan will enter Paradise alongside him.Evidence from the Sunnah\"The one who raises an orphan and I are like these [two] in Paradise (and he pointed to his middle and index fingers)\" (Bukhari).\"An orphan's guardian, whether he is a relative or nonrelative, and I are like these two in Paradise\" (Muslim).\"Whoever takes in the orphan of two Muslim parents and provides him with food and drink until he can support himself, will enter Paradise\" (Ahmed).\"The best of homes in the sight of God is that in which an orphan is well treated\" (reported by al Tabarani from a raised-chain hadith narrated by Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both).\"The person who provides for a widow and a needy person is like one who strives for the sake of God, and I think he said, \"like the person who does not tire of praying and the person who frequently fasts\" (reported by Bukhari and Muslim from a narration of Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him).Adoption in IslamAdoption is taking in another's child as one's own. Islam prohibits adoption and deems all its consequences invalid as attested to by the words of God,\"…nor does He make your adopted sons into real sons. These are only words from your mouths, while God speaks the truth and guides people to the right path. Name your adopted sons after their real fathers; this is more equitable in God's eyes—if you do not know who their real fathers are [they are your] 'brothers-in-religion' and protégés\" (Quran 33:4-5).God commanded that whoever sponsors an orphan child is not to attribute it to himself, but to its biological father if he is known; otherwise, the child should be called 'Mawla' or 'brother-in-religion'. In this way, Islam prevents people from changing truths and preserves the rights of heirs from loss or reduction. It also protects against mingling between the sexes, and being in the private company of a non-mahram (persons to whom marriage is legitimate) such as that between the male adoptee and the mahrams (persons to whom marriage is prohibited) of his adoptive father as well as between a female adoptee and her adoptive father, his sons and male relatives.It is permissible In Islamic law for the guardian of an orphan, man or woman, to add his/her family name to that of his ward who is an orphan or to a child of unknown parentage. It is likewise permissible to change the last component of the child's full name to that of his guardian in a manner that shows the ward's affiliation to his guardian without deceiving the child or others that he is the guardian's biological offspring. The purpose is to remove the affiliation from the scope of adoption which is prohibited in Islamic law. Such an addition to the child's full name is tantamount to the bonds of loyalty between the Arabian tribes of old. This is permissible in Islamic law and achieves the child's interests in the different phases of his life though the principles of Islamic law concerning adoption and its legal consequences must be preserved."

    "Question": "A barber is asking for the ruling of shaving the beard and threading the face. Most of his customers shave their beards and insist on having him thread their faces. The inquirer has no other work and supports his family and siblings.",
    "Answer": "Shaving the beard is one of the issues over which there is a scholarly debate. While the majority of scholars maintain that shaving the beard unlawful, the Shafi'is maintain that it is disliked. They base their opinion — that it is recommended to keep the beard and refrain from shaving it — on their understanding of the command pertaining to customs; food and drink; clothing; sitting; and appearance; and used the examples of the command to dye one's hair and pray in one's footwear and the like to substantiate their opinion.The same applies to threading the face; scholars differ on whether removing hair other than that of the eyebrows is considered nams [En. Plucking facial hair and eyebrows] which is prohibited in the Shari'ah. This is because the opinion of some scholars from the different schools of jurisprudence and the established opinion of the Malikis is that plucking facial hair other than the eyebrows is permissible and entails no prohibition — unlike the majority of scholars who maintain that it falls under nams which one is warned against in the noble hadith. We favor the opinion of the majority of scholars and are inclined to follow it.The Islamic legal maxim states: - Objection is reserved for omitting what is agreed on by scholars to be a requirement, and performing something that is agreed to be unlawful. - Objection is not for issues where there is a difference of opinion. - It is preferable to remove oneself from controversial issues. - Whoever is afflicted with something controversial may follow the opinion of the scholar who permits it\".Based on this and in reference to the question, there is no harm if you shave the beards or thread the faces of those customers who ask you to do so as long as you follow the opinion of the scholars who permit it, especially since you have no other work. Therefore the money you earn from your work is, by the will of Allah, lawful though we advise you to refrain from shaving beards and threading faces as much as possible."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/4865/what-is-the-islamic-ruling-for-women-covering-their-faces-niqab",
    "Question": "What is the Islamic ruling for women covering their faces (niqab)?",
    "Answer": "There are two distinctions that need to be made before answering the question. The head covering (hijab) is what Muslim women wear to cover their hair and is a general cover. The veil, or the face covering (niqab), is a specific covering worn by some.The vast majority of jurists have ruled that a women’s entire body is considered nakedness for all non-related men except the hands and the face. The exception of the face and the hands is due to the necessity of women interacting with men, buying, selling, and the like. It has also been narrated that Abu Hanifa ruled that even a women’s feet can be exposed as God has prohibited exposing women’s adornment except that which naturally is manifest and Abu Hanifa included the feet in this definition, i.e. that which is naturally manifest. While Imam Ahmad argued that the entire body of a women is to be covered even her nails, as it is all considered nakedness. He is reported to have said whomever has the wife of his host present [at a meal] it is not permissible to share this meal with them since while eating the women’s hands become exposed. The Qadi of the Hanbali School said that it is impermissible for a man to gaze at a non-related woman except her face and hands.The majority of jurists have used as their text proof the verse, “and to [not] display of their adornment only that which is apparent” meaning from that which is apparent so kohl is the adornment of the eye and the ring is the adornment of the hands. Ibn Kathir quoted al-‘Amash as saying regarding this verse, “on the authority of Sa‘id ibn Jabir, on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas who said, “and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent” means her hands including rings and her face. This has been narrated by Ibn ‘Umar, ‘Ata, ‘Ikrimma, Sa ‘id ibn Jabeer, Abi Shasha’, Dahak, Ibrahim al-Nakh‘I, and others.’” As for the sunnah there is the hadith narrated by Aisha that “Asma bint Abi Bakr entered upon the Prophet and she had on a light garment so the Prophet turned away from her and said ‘Asma’ when a women comes of age (has reached puberty) it is not proper of her to display except this and this’, and he pointed to his face and hands.” Another source of evidence is the hadith where the Prophet reminded women to give charity out of fear of Hell fire and in the text of the hadith it says, “a women amongst the most pious of them who had dark brown cheeks asked ‘why O Messenger of God?’” The narrator of this hadith, Jabir, alludes to the fact that this woman had her face exposed and he saw this. As for the statement that the hijab has been abrogated by niqab from the verse, “O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks close round them. That will be better, so that they may be recognized and not annoyed. God is ever Forgiving, Merciful” there is no clear indication that this is a reference for covering the face.Al-Marghani from the Hanafi School has stated, “the nakedness of a free women is her entire body except her face and hands as is inferred from the statement of the Prophet ‘the women is a hidden nakedness’ and he excluded the face and the hands due to the extreme hardship in covering them. This statement includes the feet as nakedness, but there is another opinion in the Hanafi School that says the feet are not nakedness and this is the sounder opinion.” Ibn Khalaf al-Baji from the Maliki School has stated, “the entire body of a woman is nakedness except her feet and hands.” He has also stated elsewhere that, “a women eats with her husband and [male] guests or with her brother. This means that a man’s glance at a women’s face or hands is permissible as these manifest themselves during eating.” Ibn Hajar al-Haytami (of the Shafi School) has quoted Qadi ‘Iyad as saying that a woman does not have to cover her face as in accordance with scholarly agreement. “Qadi Iyad states that a women walking in the streets is not obliged to cover her face as it is a recommended act (not obligatory), and men passing by are to lower their gaze in accordance with the Quranic verse.” Clothes and manners of dress are deeply related to customs and traditions of peoples. In a country like Egypt were a woman covering her face is not that common and were it causes familial problems, it is more appropriate to follow the majority opinion. As for other countries where the Hanbali opinion is more in line with local custom it is permissible for a women to follow this opinion, i.e. of covering the face etc, as it is not a sign of a women’s religiosity, but rather in line with custom and tradition. In accordance with the above we side with the majority opinion which is the permissibility of a woman exposing her face and hands and the covering of everything else. We also are of the opinion that if the niqab becomes a sign for the fracturing of the Muslim community, or a sign for religiosity then its ruling changes from one of a recommended act (mandub) and a permissible act (mubah) to one of reprehensible innovation (bid‘a) especially if it is used for things which God has not ordained on us and God is most high and all knowledgeable."

I would like to know the ruling for mechanical slaughtering, taking into account that the person operating the slaughter machine utters \"Bismillah, Allahu Akbar\" [In the name of Allah, Allah is the greatest] once.",
    "Answer": "Scholars unanimously agree that anything that causes the blood to flow and severs the jugular veins is considered a slaughtering tool except for a finger nail, toe nail or tooth which is still attached to the body. This is because slaughtering an animal with a tooth or nail that is still attached to the body is considered asphyxiation.Based on this, if the case is indeed as mentioned in the question, i.e. that the birds are machine slaughtered and the person operating the machine utters the name of Allah [bismillah] and glorifies Him [Allahu akbar], then this manner of slaughtering is permissible and there is no harm in it.The answer is known from the above and Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/4869/what-is-the-ruling-of-celebrating-mother’s-day",
    "Question": "What is the ruling of celebrating mother’s day?",
    "Answer": "Human beings are the edifice of the Lord [bunyan al-rabb] whom God has honored for their Adamic nature. God created Adam with His hands and breathed into him from His spirit. He made the angels prostrate to him and expelled Satan from His mercy because he was too proud to obey His command to prostrate to Adam. Respect for humankind is an angelic quality upon which Islamic civilization has been built. The disrespect, degradation, and contempt of humankind is a satanic tendency that has shaken the foundation of the civilizations that have been built upon it. God struck at the foundations of their building, and then the roof fell down upon them from above them, and the doom came on them whence they knew not [16:26]; Whoso chooseth Satan for a patron instead of God is verily a loser and his loss is manifest [4:119]; Will ye choose him and his seed for your protecting friends instead of Me, when they are an enemy unto you ? Calamitous is the exchange for evil-doers [18:50].Islam advocates honoring all of humanity for their humanity regardless of their race or color, but at the same time Islam added another honor in connection with specific roles that certain individuals have in accordance with particularities that God created in them. Honoring one’s parents whom God has made the reason for one’s existence falls into this category since God associated being thankful to them with being thankful to Him, And We have enjoined upon man concerning his partners - His mother beareth him in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years - Give thanks unto Me and unto thy parents. Unto Me is the journeying [31:14]; and He made the command to be good towards them after the command to worship Him, Thy Lord hath decreed, that ye worship none save Him, and (that ye show) kindness to parents [17:23]. This is because He made them the apparent cause of creation, so they are the greatest manifestation in the universe of God’s attribute of creation thereby communicating an honor upon honor.The Prophet made mothers the most deserving among people of good company, and placed them even above fathers in this respect. Abu Hurayrah said, “A man came to the Messenger of God and asked, ‘Whom among people is the most deserving of my goodly companionship?’ He replied, ‘your mother.’ The man asked, ‘Then whom?’ He replied, ‘Your mother.’ The man asked, ‘Then whom?’ He replied, ‘Your mother.’ The man asked, ‘Then whom?’ He replied, ‘Then your father.’” The shari’ah affirms that the relationship between a child and its mother is a natural organic relationship. A child’s kinship to his/her mother does not rely on being the product of wedlock or fornication; she is its mother regardless, contrary to the child’s father whose kinship is only established by legal means [i.e. through wedlock]. Some of the expressions of honoring one’s mother are to celebrate her, to obey her, and to treat her well. There is nothing in the shari’ah to prevent there being an occasion for this on which children express their obedience to their mothers.This is an organizational matter to which there is no impediment. There is no connection here to the issue of innovation that many people murmur incessantly (yadandan) about this matter. The innovation that is rejected is that which has been brought about not in accordance with the shari’ah based on the saying of the Prophet, “Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours which is not of it, is rejected.” The meaning of this is that whoever innovates something in it that is from it is accepted and not rejected. The Prophet approved of the Arab’s celebrations of their national remembrances and communal victories of which they used to sing celebrating the glorious deeds of their tribes and the days of their victories. According to Aishah the Prophet came upon her when there were two slave-girls with her who were singing of the day of Bu’ath. It is related in the sunna that the Prophet visited the grave of his mother Amenah in Alfay Muqanni’, and he was not seen more tearful than on that day. The concept of motherhood is for Muslims a very elevated concept, and their linguistic tradition clearly bears witness to this. The Arabic word for mother is also used to refer to an origin, a home, a leader, and one who serves the community by being in charge of their food and service. This last meaning is related according to Imam al-Shafi’i, who is one of the people of the language. Ibn Durayd said, “Everything to which other things that followed it are joined is called ‘mother’ by the Arabs.” This is why Mecca is called ‘Mother of Cities’ (umm al-qura) being at the center of the earth, the direction in which people face in prayer, and the most honored city in the world.”Since language is the vessel of thought, the semantic value of this word has bound Muslims to that honored person whom God caused to be the origin of creation for human beings, with whom He provided for them a home, who raised them and inspired their ways of thought, the service and caretaking of whom God has made well-loved. In all of this mothers are the receptacles of care and mercy, with whom their children seek shelter and refuge. If this concept is clear in the original linguistic meaning and its derivatives of the Arabic word for mother, Muslims’ cultural heritage makes it even clearer. This is evidenced in the term keeping up with uterial kin where the anatomical particularity of mothers is used as a symbol for familial connections, which are the building blocks of society. This usage stems from the fact that there is none more entitled to this association than mothers through whom the meaning of life continues, families are established, and mercy is manifest. This concept is fully realized when considered along with the singular religious concept that the Chosen Prophet and beloved describes in his saying, “The womb is attached to the Throne. It says, ‘Whoever establishes a connection with me, God connects to them, and whoever breaks a connection with me, God breaks away from them.” The Divine Utterance (hadith qudsi) says, “God says, ‘I am God, and I am the All Merciful. I created the womb (al-rahim) and derived [it’s name] from My name. Whoever connects to it, I connect to them, and whoever severs ties with it I cut them off.’” Through this elevated meaning of motherhood that we have which is manifested as a linguistic meaning, a cultural inheritance, and a religious position we can perceive the breadth of the wide chasm and the great dissimilarity between us and the other for whom family values have disintegrated and whose connections have been separated in its collapse. This makes them seek out these occasions and thirst for them pleading with them for something of the values that have been lost. These holidays have become like what can be termed ‘emotional begging’ carried out by children whose attention is turned by it to the remembrance of their mothers by giving them a symbolic gift while they chase a course through life that only looks ahead and never behind.In spite of this difference between us and other cultures whose situation has brought about these occasions, this does not represent a legal religious prohibition to our celebrating them. We consider, rather, that taking part in them involves spreading the values of doing good by one’s parents in an age in which disobedience is, unfortunately, a spreading phenomenon. We have a goodly example in the Prophet who used to love and praise virtues in everyone even if they were adherents of another religion. When the prisoners from Tayyi’ were brought before him the daughter of Hatim al-Ta’i was among them. “O Muhammad,” She said to the Prophet, “Why don’t you let us go and not cause the misfortune of the Arab tribes through me. I am the daughter of my people’s leader. My father used to protect honor (yahmi al-dhimar), release captives, satiate the hungry, clothe the naked, entertain guests, offer food, spread peace, and he never turned away someone in need. I am the daughter of Hatim al-Ta’i.” The Prophet said, “O girl, these are truly the characteristics of a believer; if your father had been a Muslim we would have beseeched mercy on his behalf (tarahhamna ‘alayhi). Let her go, her father loved virtue, and God loves virtue.” Abu Burdah ibn Niyar stood and said, “O Messenger of God, does God love virtue?” The Prophet said, “By He in Whose Hand is my soul, none shall enter paradise except through virtue.” The Prophet also said, “In the home of ‘Abd Allah ibn Jud’an I witnessed virtues that are dearer to me than a red camel (rare and precious type of camels at the prophet’s time). If I had been called by it in Islam I would have answered.” Based on this, celebrating mother’s day is permissible according to the legal tradition and there is nothing to prevent it or be a cause for its prohibition. Being joyful for occasions of victory and other occasions is also permissible. The innovation that is rejected is only that which contradicts the legal tradition. That for which there is a basis in the legal tradition is not rejected and there is no sin involved in partaking in it. And God is Most High and Knows Best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5839/what-bearings-do-visions-have-in-islam",
    "Question": "What bearings do visions have in Islam?",
    "Answer": "The Shari‘ah is a system that governs and manages all things perceived and processed from sensory experience. This is why one finds legal rulings in all aspects of life such as, industry, trade, medicine, and social issues. The rulings of Islamic law are not limited, therefore, to acts of worships and articles of faith as assumed by some. The Shari‘ah also concerns itself with other aspects of human life such as sleep and those things that are to be done to prepare for it such as making ablution, mentioning the name of God, sleeping on the right side etc as well as those things that occur during it such as dreams, glad tidings, and nightmares which can all be classified under the term visions. Thus Islam has not left anything, no matter how small, without dealing with it “We have neglected nothing in the Book.” The scholars have been vigilant in defining the term “sleep” in order to appropriately cast rulings on visions. Ibn Amir al-Hajj has stated “Sleep is a state that occurs to the intellect that necessitates the incapacity of a person to perceive sensory things, to conduct involuntary actions, and the general use of the intellect.” Therefore based on this definition the following can be said about visions:Linguistic Meaning:Visions, specifically night visions, are those images that are seen by a person while asleep.Legal Implications:Al-Mazari has said, “God creates in the heart of the sleeping person beliefs just has He creates in a waking person, and He does as He wills; He is not halted by sleep or waking states. These beliefs are knowledge of other things, which are created in a second state or they are things actually created. For instance if a person dreams that they are flying, it most probably means that this is a belief not according to what is naturally known so this is an indication that this is a belief of another thing created by God, and all things are created by God” Visions According to the Sufis:Some of the great Sufi saints have stated that visions are “from the imaginary realm and are henceforth called imagination. These are usually present with intellects bound to the heavens and souls that understand universals and particulars. These visions are thus an expression of these lofty understandings. These visions can either come from an ill disposition, or they can come from directing the self with imaginary strength to display a certain image. This second type is like one who concentrates on their absent beloved and the picture of the beloved appears in their imagination so they can witness the person. This is the first principle upon which revelation is based.” Muhyi al-Din ibn al-Arabi has stated that the first principle of revelation is a true vision that is not confused for common dreams. And this vision does not occur except at night. Aisha has narrated that the beginning of the revelation to the Prophet was in the form of visions, he did not see a night vision except that it came as clear as morning. Revelation begins with visions and not other sense perceptions since meanings of the intellect are nearer to the imagination than to the senses; the senses are lower on the spectrum than meanings, which are higher and subtler, and imagination falls between the two. Since revelation is pure meaning, the beginning of revelation is the descent of these meanings in sensory forms that are present in the imagination that appear in sleep or waking states. Meanings that are sent to the senses must first pass through the imagination, as the imagination in reality is that which first perceives everything that appears to the senses.If this Divine revelation appears in sleep it is called a vision and if it appears in a waking state it is called imagination meaning it was made manifest to the person. After this imaginary visions are given to the angels so they can take the form of men and appear to other men who can be perceived by all people present. The Prophet would receive a revelation through his heart and he would physically feel the immense weight of this upon his body which is a type of temporary spiritual state since a permanent one such as this is not befitting to him. This is also why such temporary spiritual states would be highly intense. Visions are therefore not only for the prophets, they are something that occur to all Muslims and the veracity of them increases with time as is mentioned by the Messenger of God, “As time increases a believers vision does not increase in falsehood. The most honest vision is for those whose speech is most honest, and the vision of a believer is one part of forty-six parts of prophecy. Visions are threefold: the true vision is a glad tiding from God, a vision from the grief of Satan, and a vision that occurs from people themselves. If one of you sees a vision that they dislike, let them arise, pray, and not speak of it to anyone.” From this discussion it should be clear the importance of visions, their reality and their relationship to the Shari‘ah, and God is most high and all knowledgeable."

    "Answer": "Such kinds of celebrations have become social occasions. Therefore, there is no objection to participating in them provided a Muslim does not do anything that contradicts the Islamic creed.It is lawful [halal] in Islamic law to specify a day for renewing lawful love between spouses or among friends and family. This is because there is nothing in Islamic law to prohibit this. However, this occasion must not be called \"Eid\" (feast), but \" Love's Day\" (Youm al-Hob)."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/4847/is-it-permissible-for-us-to-recite-the-chapter-of-fatiha-during-engagement-ceremo",
    "Question": "Some scholars are of the opinion that the Fatiha should be avoided during the Khitba as this practice has become common in some countries and has reached the level of being \"part\" of the Khitba (engagement ceremony). However, it is to my understanding that Fatiha in accordance to the sunnah is not \"part\" of the Khitba and is a \"cultural\" practice. Should a person avoid reading Fatiha during the Khitba to avoid falling into something that is not permissible in Islam according to some scholars?",
    "Answer": "It is legally permissible to read Al-Fatiha on the following occasions:- When beginning or ending du'a` [supplication]. - For fulfilling needs. - When commencing reconciliation gatherings. - When conducting marriage contracts and the like. This is based on general legal evidences recommending reading the Qur`an on the one hand and the numerous legal evidences denoting the special importance of Al-Fatiha for achieving goals, fulfilling needs and facilitating matters on the other. General evidences from primary texts The Qur`anAllah Almighty says, Those who recite the Book of Allah, establish regular prayers, and spend (in charity) out of what we have provided for them, secretly and openly, hope for a commerce that will never fail. [Fatir, 29] The Sunnah Abu Umama al-Bahli (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet said, \"Read the Qur`an for verily it will come on the Day of Judgment as an intercessor for its reciters\" [Muslim].It is established in Usul al-Fiqh [principles of Islamic Jurisprudence] that commands which are mutlaq [unconditional] demand their general applicability with regards to people, circumstances, times and places. This means that, when Allah Almighty legislates a matter in a general ['amm] or unconditional fashion, it must be applied as such; it is not permissible to restrict or specify it in any manner without evidence from Islamic law. Restricting matters that Allah and His Messenger have left open and capacious leads to innovation in religion.The Prophet's observance of certain parts of general comprehensive rulings ['umum shumuli] or general rulings denoting specificity ['umum badali] does not specify the general nor restrict the unconditional as long as he did not prohibit otherwise. Legal theorists have explained this through the legal axiom \"Abstention is not proof.\" Meaning, the fact that the Prophet refrained from performing certain acts is not proof to their prohibition. Muslim scholars from among the predecessors and successors have unanimously agreed on this. Applying the legal axiom Despite his thorough understanding of the concept of offensive bid'a, the Hanbali scholar, Ibn Taymiyya fathomed this legal axiom and applied it to his acts of worship by making Al-Fatiha part of his wird [daily portion of recitations]. Ibn Taymiyya's student, Abu Hafs al-Bazzar, wrote in his book Al-'Alam Al-'Aliya fi Manaqib Ibn Taymiya that his teacher [Ibn Taymiya] would read Al-Fatiha repeatedly after fajr [dawn] prayer until sunrise. If the Prophet's abstention from reading Al-Fatiha in this manner evidences its impermissibility, then Ibn Taymiyya's practice would have been considered a bid'a that contradicts the Sunnah. However, since dhikr [making remembrance of Allah] and Qur`anic recitations are unrestricted and are only determined by what a Muslim finds in his heart, Ibn Taymiyya's act is legally permissible. In general, Al-Fatiha is a part of the Qur`an and a kind of dhikr. It is permissible to recite it under any conditions in the absence of restrictive evidence, such as the prohibition of reciting the Qur`an while in a state of janaba [major ritual impurity]. The virtues of Al-Fatiha Legal evidences have established that Al-Fatiha, in particular, excels over other Qur`anic chapters with regards to achieving goals, fulfilling needs, facilitating matters and answering the du'a`. Allah Almighty says, And We have bestowed upon you [Mohammad] the seven oft-repeated (verses) and the great Qur'an. [Al-Hijr, 87] - Abu Sa'id Ibn al-Mu'alla (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet said, \" 'All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds' [i.e. Al-Fatiha] is the seven oft-repeated verses and the great Qur`an which I was given\" [Bukhari]. - The Prophet told Jabir Ibn 'Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with them), \"O Jabir, shall I inform you of the best Surah in the Qur`an?\" Jabir replied, \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah.\" The Prophet said, \"The Opening of the Book.\" Jabir, the narrator of the hadith, said, \"I think the Prophet added \"It [Al-Fatiha] is a cure for every disease\" [Recorded by Al-Baihaqi in Shu'ab Al-Iman]. - 'Ubada Ibn As-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet said, \"The Mother of the Qur`an [i.e. Al-Fatiha] is a substitute for other Surahs while other Surahs do not substitute it\" [Recorded by Ad-Darqutni and al-Hakim]. Status of Al-Fatiha in the Shari'ah • Rukn [integral] of prayerThe majority of scholars have agreed that reciting Al-Fatiha in every rak'a [unit of prayer] of prescribed and voluntary prayers is obligatory for its validity. It is also legally established to recite it in the funeral prayer. • Ruqya The special virtues of Al-Fatiha, is what led Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri to recite it as a ruqya without prior permission from the Prophet and without being informed by him that it comprises healing words. When Abu Sa'id told the Prophet of what he did, the Prophet did not censure him or consider his action a bid'a but approved and deemed it valid and asked him, \"How did you know it was the words which cure?\" [Bukhari and Muslim]. [In another narration], the Prophet told the Companions, \"You were right\" [Bukhari]. • A protection from evil Although there were no legal texts specifying the recitation of Al-Fatiha on certain occasions, it was reported that the Companions exhorted the people to recite it. Asma` bint Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them both) said, \"Whoever reads Al-Fatiha, Al- Ikhlas, Al-Falaq and An-Nas after performing Jumu'ah [Friday] prayer, will be protected [from evils] until the next Friday\" [Recorded by Ibn Abu Shaybah in his Musanaf ]. • A means to bring blessings Commencing any matter with Al-Fatiha is patterned after its order in the noble Qur`an. The word fatiha means beginning and this is [precisely] the reason why the surah was so called since it occurs at the beginning of the Qur`an. Therefore, reciting it at the inception of any matter is by way of seeking Allah's guidance and support. In his book Zad al-Mi'ad, the Hanbali scholar, Ibn al-Qayyim wrote on the virtues of Al-Fatiha: \"[The attributes of Surat Al-Fatiha]—Fatihat al-Kitab [Opening of the Book], Um al-Qur`an [the mother of the Qur`an], As-Sab' al-Mathani [the seven oft-repeated verses], ash-Shifa` At-Tam [perfect cure], Ad-Dawa` al-Nafi' [useful treatment], Ar-Ruqya At-Tama [perfect healing], Muftah al-Ghina wa al-Falah [key to richness and success], Hafizat al-Quwah [protective shield] and Dafi'at al-Ham wa al-Gham wa al-Khawf wa al-Huzn [relief from distress, fear and sorrow] are only actualized for a person who realizes its status, gives it its due right, is aware of the manner of its application for illness and seeking its treatment and knows the secret of its potency. When some of the Companions realized these secrets, one of them read it over a person who was stung [by a scorpion] and he immediately recovered. The Prophet asked them, \"How did you know that it is a cure?\"A person who is granted success and insight will understand the mysteries of this surah and what it comprises. It affirms monotheism; knowing of the essence of Allah, His Names, Attributes, and actions/decrees; establishes religious law; includes an acknowledgment of Allah's right to being worshipped to the exception of everything else and His exclusive Lordship; absolute reliance on Allah and relegating all affairs to Him, the Disposer of all affairs to Whom belongs all praise and all that is good; professing our need for His help in guiding us which is the core of happiness both in this life and in the next; knowing the relevancy of its meanings to the fulfillment of our interests and for warding off evils of this world and the next; and knowing that the prosperous and perfect outcome of our lives and blessings are contingent upon following its meanings. This surah is a remedy for the ailments of mind and spirit, opens up the gates to abundant blessings and wards off evil. To realize this, a person must develop a sublime disposition and the faculty of reflection and must foster his faith.\" A means to fulfilling needs Scholars have based their opinion on the permissibility of reading Al-Fatiha for fulfilling needs on the hadith narrated by Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) in which the Prophet said, \"Allah Almighty says: 'I have divided the prayer into two halves between Me and My slave and My slave shall have what he asks for.' When the slave of Allah says, 'Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds', Allah Almighty says, 'My slave has praised Me.' When the slave says, 'The All-Merciful, the Compassionate', Allah says, 'My slave has spoken well of Me'. When the slave says, 'Owner of the Day of Judgment', Allah says, 'My slave has glorified Me' [and in another narration 'My slave has submitted to Me']. When the slave says, 'You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help', Allah says, 'This is between Me and My slave, and for My slave is what he asks for.' When the slave says, 'Guide us to the straight Path, the Path of those whom You have blessed, not of those with whom You are angry, nor those who are in error,' Allah says, 'This is for My slave, and for My slave is what he asks for\" [Muslim and others]. The righteous predecessors followed this without censure. In his book Ath-Thawab, Abu al-Sheikh reported that 'Atta` (may Allah have mercy on him) said, \"If you have a need, read Al-Fatiha in full and you will have [your need] fulfilled by the will of Allah.\" In his book Al-Asrar Al-Marfu'a, Mulla 'Ali al-Qari said, \"This is the basis for the custom of reciting Al-Fatiha for fulfilling needs and achieving goals.\" Established opinions of the four followed schools of fiqh The Hanafi scholarsHanafi scholars have maintained the recommendation of reading Al-Fatiha when sitting down for meals. In his book Bariqa Mahmuddiya , under the section on food etiquette, al-Khadimi wrote: \"As for reading Al-Fatiha, some scholars have reported the opinion of Ali al-Qari in his book Sharh Mukhtasar al-Ihya' in which he said: \"The common practice of reciting Al-Fatiha, is recommended because it includes praising Allah and asking Him for guidance to the straight path.\" According to the dominant opinion of the Hanafis, it is permissible to read Al-Fatiha after obligatory prayers. In his book Bariqa Mahmuddiya (vol.1, p.98), al-Khadimi said: \"There is a scholarly contention on reciting Al-Fatiha after obligatory prayers.\"- In Mi'raj Ad-Diraya, it is considered a bid'a though it is recommended because it has become a custom. It is therefore impermissible to prevent it.- In Burhan Ad-Deen's collection of Fatawa, it is disliked to read Al-Fatiha, silently or audibly, after obligatory prayers.- In al-Sa'di's collection of Fatawa, it is desirable [to read Al-Fatiha after obligatory prayers]. - In the collection of Fatawa Tatarkhaniya, al-Quniya and al-Ashbah: \"Reciting Al-Fatiha after obligatory prayers takes precedence over reciting traditional invocations made at their prescribed times. Among these are the numerous invocations which the master of mankind, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, is reported to have made at the conclusion of obligatory prayers.\" - In Fusul al-Asrushani: \"Reading Al-Fatiha takes precedence over the traditional invocations at their prescribed times.\" Based on these citations, the preponderant opinion is its permissibility due to the great number of scholars who maintained it. An offensive bid'a is that which is not based on evidence. Al-Fatiha teaches us the manner of supplicating Allah and asking Him for help—it was revealed to show the best manner of making du'a`. The best du'a` is that which is made at the best times from among which are after obligatory prayers. Thus, its permissibility is indisputable.\" The Maliki scholars The Malikis have maintained the permissibility of reciting Al-Fatiha when seeing someone off on a journey. In his commentary on Ash-Sharh As-Saghir , As-Sawi said: \"Sheikh Abd al-Rahman At-Tajuri objected to reading Al-Fatiha when seeing someone off on a journey on the basis that it was not mentioned in the Sunnah. In response, Al-Ajhuri commented that it was mentioned in some Sunnah texts and is therefore permissible.\" The Shafi'i scholarsIn his collection of Fatawa , Al-Shihab al-Ramli reported the following fatwa: Question \"What is the ruling for ending the du'a` after obligatory prayers with Al-Fatiha? Is there a basis for it in the Sunnah or is it a bid'a that was not followed by early Muslims? And if it is bid'a, is it good or offensive? If it is undesirable, will its reciter be rewarded? Answer There is a basis in the Sunnah for reciting Al-Fatiha after the du'a` made at the end of some prayers due to the numerous virtues it entails. The Prophet said, \"The Opening of the Book is suspended to the Throne of Allah with no barrier between them.\" It is a Surah like no other. Scholars have said that it comprises the meanings of the entire Qur`an. It is made up of 25 words which encompass the Qur`anic sciences since it includes praising Allah Most High through His Attributes of Perfection and Beauty; exhorting sincere observance of acts of worship; admitting one's incapability of performing acts of worship except with the help of Allah; it includes supplications for guidance to the straight path and establishes the end of those who go astray.The virtues of Al-Fatiha include the following: It is divided between Allah and His servant; prayers are invalid without it and the reward of its recitation outweighs that of any other good deed. This is why it is known as Umm al-Qur`an. It also has many names and this multiplicity is an indication of its importance. These names include: the Surah of Du'a`[supplication], Munaja [secret talk to Allah], At-Tafweed [referring affairs to Allah], Ar-Raqiya [healing], Ash-Shifaa`[the cure] as per the words of the Prophet: \"It [Al-Fatiha] is a cure for every disease.\" Scholars said, 'If one is ill, he is to recite Al-Fatiha because it is a cure.' In his collection of Al-Fatawa Al-Fiqhiya Al-Kubra , Ibn Hajar al-Haitami mentioned: \"It is recommended to read Al-Fatiha when afflicted with the plague since it is a cure for every disease.\" The Hanbali scholars Imam Ahmed Ibn Hanbal used Al-Fatiha in writing permissible amulets. Ibn Muflih wrote in Al-Adab Al-Shari'ya : \"Al-Maruzi said: 'A woman who was living alone complained to Abu Abdullah of loneliness. Thereupon, he wrote the name of Allah, Al-Fatiha, Al-Ikhlas, Al-Falaq, An-Nas and Ayat al-Kursi [the verse of the Throne] on a piece of paper [and gave it to her].\" It was previously mentioned that Ibn Taymiyya (may Allah have mercy on him) made Al-Fatiha his morning wird. His student, Ibn al-Qayyim, recommended that a mufti is to recite it before issuing fatawa [legal verdicts]. He reported this opinion from some of the predecessors although the Sunnah does not mention anything in this regard. In his book 'Ilam Al-Muwaq'een 'An Rab Al-'Alameen , Ibn al-Qayyim said: \"It is only fitting that a mufti make the [following] du'a` in abundance: 'O Allah, Lord of Jibril, Mika'il and Israfil, Originator of the heavens and earth and Knower of the seen and the unseen! You adjudicate between Your servants regarding their differences, so by Your leave, direct me to the truth of that which they differ on. Verily, You guide whom You will to the straight path.\" Before issuing a fatwa, some of the predecessors would say: \"Glory be to You! We have knowledge only of what You have taught us. You are the All Knowing and All Wise.\" Some of them would recite Al-Fatiha and we [Hanafi scholars] tried it with the best results.\" The predecessors and successors followed this practice. The Hanbali scholar, Yusuf Ibn 'Abdul Hadi, who was known as Ibn al-Mibrad authored a treatise on the virtues of Al-Fatiha, entitled Al-Isti'ana bi Al-Fatiha 'ala Nagah Al-`Umur in which he quoted and commented on Imam Ibn al-Qayyim's previous words in Zad al-Mi'ad. In his book, he said: \"[Ibn al-Qayyim's] words are praiseworthy; however, when compared to the virtues of Al-Fatiha, they are merely tantamount to the dip of the bird's beak in the sea or to a drop of water that it drinks from it. Our Sheikh Abu al-Farag Ibn al-Hibal depended heavily on Al-Fatiha for fulfilling needs and resolving matters successfully. When making amulets, he would commence by writing Al-Fatiha, recite it over them and then recite it once more when folding them up. And whenever he would write a letter to anyone, he would recite it over the letter. I testify to its great virtue as a means of fulfilling needs. I read it for matters of both this world and the Hereafter and they prospered. How many times has its recitation successfully resolved difficult and unattainable matters and yielded better results? It is [indeed] a great surah and you—may Allah bless you—should recite it in abundance for the prosperity of all matters, needs, treatments and every aspect of life. Reflect on this and you will find its virtues manifest. It has many virtues and countless secrets that only manifest themselves to those who discern. Allah is the Ever-Supporter and Giver of success.\" The ruling Contesting opinions that crop up every so often concerning the matter of dhikr, which the predecessors and successors practiced, and which prevent people from practicing it in their homes, gatherings and at their times of joy, are but attributes of innovation and misguidance irrespective of their purport. It is indeed fatal to call for eliminating Muslims' customs that have been established by Islamic civilization throughout its history and which have fashioned the behavior and traditions of Muslims under the pretext of following and applying the teachings of the Shari'ah. Advocates of this false claim are unaware or heedless to the fact that such a call may forfeit the religious essence of public ceremonies and eliminate dhikr from social life and cultural system which is precisely the call of materialists and atheists. Hence, such ignorant folk who talk about what they do not know must be mindful of Allah and leave the matter of fatwa to the prudent scholars who are versed in the reality of the times and understand the consequences of rulings. Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "I am a woman who embraced Islam four months ago and I had a tattoo drawn across my back ten years ago. I have known recently that tattoo is prohibited in Islam. So what should I do about the tattoo I am having given that removing it would be very painful and expensive and it won’t appear to anyone but my husband?",
    "Answer": "Tattoo as a term has two meanings. The first of which is the process of stitching a needle into the skin until blood oozes out and then different kinds of dyes are placed in these opening wounds to penetrate through the body and remain there with no removal. The second meaning has to do with the result of this process which is the drawn tattoo.Tattoos are prohibited in Islam according to the authentic traditions in which both the one who does tattoos and the one who draws them are cursed. Both al Bukhari and Muslim reported through ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (peace be upon him) cursed the one who does tattoos, and the one who has a tattoo done.”The scholar al Hafiz ibn Hajar said in his book (Fath al Bari) that having a tattoo is prohibited because it causes cursing and the tattooed spot of the body is deemed impure because the blood is clotted in it and therefore needs to be removed even if this causes an injury unless there is a fear of ruining or hurting an organ, only then it is permissible to keep the tattoo and repentance would suffice in lifting the sin and both men and women are equal in this issue.Repentance in this issue suffices because this is one of God’s rights which can be forgiven by the virtue of embracing Islam as God’s rights are waived by the virtue of embracing Islam. It was reported by Imam Ahmad through ‘Amr ibn al ‘As that the Prophet said “embracing Islam waives what was before it”.Imam al Qarafi in his book (al Furuq) differentiated between two kinds of rights. Rights which belong to God and rights which belong to human beings; when it comes to the rights of God, they are lifted by the virtue of embracing Islam because Islam is one of God’s rights. The Prophet said that “Islam covers up for what was done before it”. Therefore the new Muslim is not obliged to make up for prayers, zakat or any other forms of worship which he missed before becoming a Muslim. God is known for his bounty and mercy and thus His mercy matches His forgiveness. As for the rights of humans, it is known that the nature of human beings is weakness and greed and therefore they hold tight to their rights whereas God waived His rights out of compassion and mercy.Therefore if the removal of tattoos will necessitate injuring the body or causing harm to it then it is disapproved to remove it. God says in the Quran, “And God wants to lighten for you [your difficulties]; and mankind was created weak”. (4:28) and He said, “Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship… “(2:185) and also, “He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty…”(22:78) and “God does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained,” (2:286)As for praying while having these tattoos on, it is deemed permissible because it goes under forgiven impurity. Imam al Nafrawi al Maliki stated “If someone has a forbidden tattoo, he is not obliged to remove it with fire and it is rather a forgiven impurity and prayers are valid with having it” and fasting is deemed valid as well because it has nothing to do with having the tattoo on."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/4837/i-have-noticed-that-some-men-prolong-their-hair-are-they-allowed-to-do-so",
    "Question": "I have noticed that some men prolong their hair. Are they allowed to do so?",
    "Answer": "Prolonging hair for men is permissible as it falls under customary practices and intrinsic nature. Abu Dawaud reported through Abu Huraira that the Prophet said, “Whoever has hair should honor it”. Anas ibn Malik reported that the Prophet’s hair used to reach to his shoulders.Although the original ruling for men for prolonging their hair is the permissibility, customary practices change with the passage of time along with intricate circumstances which accompany the act itself and it might change its ruling from permissibility to disliked or even prohibited act. For example if prolonging a man’s hair became in a certain period of time or a specific geographical location associated with homosexuality, profligacy and debauch, it is deemed impermissible for him to prolong it. Therefore if a matter is favored and liked in itself and then became a motto associated with sinners, it becomes a prohibited matter. Scholars have stated that if the doers of sins are famous for a certain dress code, it becomes prohibited for others to wear it. It was narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet said, “whoever resembles a group of people becomes one of them”.Also whoever resembles the people who commit profligacy subjects himself to ill thinking and questioning. Sheikh ‘Ali al Qari in his book (Merqah al Mafatih Sharh Meshkat al Masabih) said that whoever resembles himself with libertines is like them.The Hanbali’s opinion on this matter is that prolonging hair is a sunnah and it is permissible for a man to make it as a braid yet Imam Ibn Muflih tied this act to not seeking fame or not being associated with unethical behavior or not going against customary practices and traditions in the society he lives in.Therefore the issue of dress codes and the way one looks depends on the customary practices and traditions of different societies and are subjected to general rules of decency such as covering the private parts of the body, prohibiting resembling the looks of profligate and lecherous people, prohibiting men resemble the looks of women and vice versa, prohibiting conceit, arrogance and pride. If these general rules are taken into consideration along with the customary practices of the society he lives in, the man is allowed to prolong his hair."

    "Question": "I live in France so what are the appropriate clothes that I can wear when I go out or during prayers. What are the limits of resembling non Muslims in their outfits in a non Muslim country?",
    "Answer": "The issue of dress codes, outfits and clothes in Islam are bound to customary practices and traditions in a manner that does not contradict Islamic teachings. In other words, prohibition only falls on the outer look which goes against Islam such as if the clothes are revealing, transparent or cut in a way which shows the private body parts. As for a Muslim wearing the same outfits that the people in his country wear- whether Muslims or non Muslims- is not counted as part of the prohibited resemblance. Islam does not ask his adherents to be unique and stand out through being different in their dress code. Islam rather calls for uniqueness and distinctiveness in terms of fine manners, high moral standards, respecting human dignity, fulfilling promises and covenants, abiding by the general rules and state system, respecting people with love and mercy. This understanding was very clear in the minds of the companions and for this reason when the companions of the Prophet entered Persia , they prayed in their trousers as dressing up in the non Muslims’ outfits is only disfavored due to two reasons: first of them is when the outfit is prohibited in itself and the second reason is when a Muslim wears a certain dress code for the sole purpose of imitating non Muslims without any necessity to do so. If these two reasons do not exist, then dressing in non Muslims’ outfits is not prohibited.As for the Prophetic hadith which was narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar in which the Prophet said, “whoever resembles a group of people is one of them”, the scholars said that this hadith means that resembling the outfit of non Muslims for the sole purpose of only resembling them is prohibited. Therefore wearing the outfits of non Muslims out of customary practices and cultural traditions without having the intention of resembling non Muslims is not impermissible. It was reported by both al Bukhari and Muslim that the Prophet (peace be uponhim) prayed in a gown that was brought from the Levant area and the Levant at that time was a non Muslim state. Muslims nowadays wear outfits which were originally the dress code of non Muslims and it is not considered a resemblance to them because with the passage of time the original act of resemblance to non Muslims was forgotten and it ceased to be a motto for their dress code. So scholars said that it became a customary outfit that got popular among people and its origin was forgotten.More importantly resemblance does not take place by the mere fact of wearing similar outfits as intention and purpose are required for resemblance to take place. Sheikh Taqi al Din ibn Taymiya stated that differing from non Muslims in terms of outfits and general habits is not obligatory if it will lead to a religious benefit or drive away a negative consequence and sometimes it reaches a point where it becomes highly favored to conform with their customary dress codes and practices and in other times this recommendation reaches a state of obligation as long as no compromise is being made in the general guidelines for Islamic dress code."

    "Question": "What is the ruling for keeping one’s garment long?",
    "Answer": "Keeping one’s garment long, meaning letting it go past the ankles and touch the floor, used to be a sign of haughtiness and arrogance which is a major sin and amongst the worse diseases of the heart. It destroy one’s spiritual life and progress to the point that some of the pious Muslims have stated that, “a sin that causes abasement and causes one to feel broken is better than a good deed that causes one to be haughty and arrogant.”The act of keeping one’s trousers or garment long is tied to arrogance in the hadith of the Prophet who said, “whomsoever drags their garment out of arrogance, God will not look at them on the Day of Resurrection. So Abu Bakr said, ‘one part of my garment sags should I consider this [act] from what you have mentioned’ so the Prophet said, ‘you are not amongst those who do this out of arrogance.’” Therefore keeping one’s garment long and having it go past the ankles and drag on the floor is itself not prohibited, rather its impermissibility draws from the fact that it was a sign of arrogance especially during the time of the Prophet. Accordingly the scholars have agreed that any form of arrogance is prohibited whether it is related to clothes or not. However, they have differed on the ruling of keeping the garment long making a distinction between those who do it out of arrogance and those who do not. Others have stated that it is a reprehensible act as it is an imitation of those who do it out of arrogance.Sheikh al-Buhuti has stated, “If someone keeps their garment long out of necessity such as covering the ailment of the feet then it is permissible as long as it is without arrogance. Ahmad has stated in a narration that keeping one’s garment long and dragging it in prayer as long as there is no arrogance, is fine.” Al-Shawkani has stated:The apparent restriction of “out of arrogance” is an indication a priori that keeping a garment long without arrogance is not a part of this threat. Ibn Abdul Barr has stated, “keeping the garment long without arrogance does not fall into the mentioned threat except that the act is looked down upon.” Al-Nawawi has stated, “[keeping the garment long] is a reprehensible act, and this is the quoted statement of Imam al-Shafi‘i as al-Buwiti has stated in his compendium on the statements of Imam al-Shafi‘i that, ‘it is not permissible to keep one’s garment long in the prayer or elsewhere out of arrogance. However, doing this elsewhere, i.e. outside of prayer, is a lighter act based on the statement of the Prophet to Abu Bakr.’” Keeping the garment long if it is without haughtiness and arrogance is permissible as has been stated by the school of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and the prohibition lies in the arrogance even if it occurs by not keeping the garment long. Also the custom of people has changed and today it is not amongst the habits of the arrogant to keep their clothes long, and therefore keeping ones garment long today cannot be an act that imitates the actions of the arrogant and the haughty. God is most high and all knowledgeable."

    "Question": "My question is about the size of beard. Is it haram to trim my beard? Were there people among the companions who trimmed their beard than a fist?",
    "Answer": "Trimming the beard is a Sunnah. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to trim his beard and cut some of its sides and the top portions in order to match the contour of his face in order to go well with his overall appearance. He also used to wash his beard with water and comb it. It is also known that the Companions of the Prophet followed him in his actions and decisions."

    "Question": "Do miracles (karamat) occur to some of the righteous during their lives? Can they continue after they have left the life of this world and passed over into the life of the barzakh?",
    "Answer": "A miracle is something that breaks the accustomed norms [of the universe] and is not accompanied or followed by a claim to prophethood which God makes apparent upon the hand of one of His servants who outwardly manifests righteousness, adheres to the religious law, diligently follows His prophet, has correct belief, and works to do good, whether he or she is known for it or not.The scholars placed conditions to close the door in the face of those who would make false claims so that the issue of miracles would not lead to people leaving Islam. They closed the door of false claims by making it a condition that one adheres to the religious law and follow the Prophet, for one who adheres to the religious law does not make false claims to the miraculous. They closed the door of leaving Islam by making it a condition that miracles are not accompanied by a claim to prophethood. Believing in the miracles of the saints is one of the bases of the creed of orthodox sunni Islam. Imam al-Tahawi said, “We believe in the miracles that occur and are authenticated by the narrations of those who are trustworthy.” Denying the miracles of the saints may bring a person out of Islam completely, and believing in them is one of the bases of the Muslim creed. The actor in the case of the miracles of the saints (karamat) is the same as in the case of the miracles of the Prophets (al-mu’jizat), He is God Alone with no partner, but He has made them manifest on the hands of the people of obedience and adherence to His law.Imam al-Jalal al-Mahli said, “(The miracles of the saints), and they are the knowers of God or the Gnostics, as is made possible for those who are continuous in their acts of obedience, desist from committing acts of disobedience, refuse to allow themselves to be preoccupied by [worldly] pleasures and desires (are real), meaning they are possible and occur, for example when the river was flowing because of ‘Umar’s letter, or his seeing his army in Nahawand while he was standing on the minbar in Madina and saying to the leader of the army, ‘O Saria, the hilltop, the hilltop,’ warning him of the enemy that was behind the mountain, and Saria hearing his words in spite of the distance; and like Khalid drinking poison without being harmed by it, and other things that occurred to the Companions and others.(Al-Qushayri said, “This includes the likes of a child being born without a father,”) and the transformation of an inanimate object into an animate object. The author said, this is a reality that makes particular someone else’s statement that whatever can be the miracle of a prophet can be the miracle of a saint; there is no difference between the two except for the challenge. Most of the Mu’tazilites did not allow for abnormal occurances at all from the saints, and neither did Abu Ishaq al-Isfarayni who said, “Everything that could be considered a miracle for a prophet cannot be a miracle for a saint. The extent of [their] miracles is for [their] prayers to be answered, [their] arriving at water in the desert when it was not expected, and similar things that do not consist of a break with the norms.’” Ibn Taymiyyah says, “The Prophet made it clear that the heart has an aspect (shu’bah) of hypocrisy and an aspect of faith. If it has an aspect of hypocrisy, then it has an aspect of sainthood, and an aspect of animosity [towards God]. This is why miracles are performed at the hands of some of them, from the aspect of their faith in God and piety, these are of the miracles of the saints.” During his mention of the hadith about calling after a lost camel Ibn Muflih said, “His saying, ‘If you hear someone calling after a lost camel in the mosque, say, ‘May God not return it to you.’’ And the saying of Ibn ‘Umar to the person in the funeral who asked forgiveness for the person and he said, ‘God will not forgive you.’ And it is said of his saying, ‘There is no nourishment’ that it is a statement meaning they will not be nourished from it at the time. And this contains an affirmation of the miracles of the saints in opposition to the Mu’tazilites.” The scholars also mentioned that one of these miracles is the ability to perceive some things that are hidden (al-ghybiyat). Concerning this Ibn ‘Abdin says, “What is mentioned in the books of theology is that one of the miracles of the saints is perceiving some of the things that are hidden. They responded to the Mu’tazilites who use these verses as evidence for this not being possible by saying that the intended meaning is that it is made apparent without an intermediary, and the intended meaning of the messenger is the angel. So His unseen is made apparent to none without an intermediary except the angel.As for the prophet and the saints, it is made apparent to them through the intermediary of the angel or another. We said much on this topic in our treatise entitled Drawing the Indian Sword in Defense of Our Master Khalid al-Naqshibandi, so go back to it for therein are rare pieces of beneficial knowledge. And God Most High Knows Best.” There is no evidence to indicate that these miracles that are affirmed for the saints end with the end of their life in the world. There is evidence, rather, that indicates the opposite. It is affirmed that God protected the body of ‘Asim ibn Thabit after his death. God sent ‘Asim a kind of shade of bees that protected him from their messengers who could not cut anything off of it.” This is explicit in the miracle that God provided for him after his death. Al-Bayjirmi said, “The question came up in the lesson about if a dead person were to miraculously recite a verse of prostration, would the person who heard it prostrate or not? He said, ‘This can be answered in that the first is what apparent, because the miracles of the saints do not come to an end with their death.Therefore there is nothing to prevent a dead person reciting a beautiful recitation and taking pleasure in it. In this case it is legislated for the person who hears it to prostrate even though the dead person is not responsible, and similarly when it is from a discerning youth. The dead person is not like one who is forgetful or an inanimate object and the like.” So belief in the miracles of the saints is something concerning which there is a consensus in the Muslim community, and the theologians considered it one of the bases of faith. Denying them may bring someone out of Islam and their being affirmed for the saints after their death is confirmed by its absolute possibility and authentic traditions. Death occurs to the body, not the spirit. The miracles of the saints cannot be denied during their lives or after their deaths.And God is Most High and Knows Best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5837/is-it-true-that-al-khidr-who-was-with-prophet-musa-is-still-alive",
    "Question": "Is it true that al-Khidr who was with Prophet Musa is still alive? Is he an angel or a human?",
    "Answer": "It is not beyond the limits of the intellect or of Islamic jurisprudence for the Khidr or any other of God’s creation to be alive. A Muslim should never be so quick to pass judgment on everything that comes their way that is not common before turning to the Shari‘ah and examining what is said regarding the issue. God is capable of prolonging anyone’s life as He has prolonged Satan’s life, not as a miracle for Satan or as a special attribute to him, but rather to serve a specific purpose in His ultimate plan. Likewise God can prolong the life of a saintly person such as Khidr as this can be a miracle attributed to him or again for another purpose we might not be aware of. As for the issue of Khidr specifically, it has been mentioned by the pious ancestors and they have acknowledged that he remains alive. Imam Muslim mentions in his Sahih the hadith of the man who will be killed by the antichrist as well as the comments of Abi Ishaq on it by saying that the Prophet said, “If this man is to be killed and then brought back to life will you be in doubt” and the companions responded in the negative and the Prophet said, “he will kill him and bring him back to life and will say, ‘by God I have never been more alive before you than this’, so he will try to kill the man again and he will be unable to”. Abu Ishaq said that this man was al-Khidr. Anas also reported during the death of the Prophet “a man with a red beard and a beautiful figure crossed among them and cried. He then turned to the companions of the Prophet and said that in God is solace from every calamity and compensation for every loss so to God turn in repentance and in Him desire and then he left. Some of the companions asked one another if they knew who the man was so Abu Bakr and Ali said “yes, he is the brother of the Prophet al-Khidr upon him be peace.” Anas also said: I went out with the Prophet one night carrying for him water for purification when he heard someone call out and said to me, “quite” and the caller said, “O God give me aid with that which will save me from that which I fear so the Prophet said, ‘he should say something else’ and it is as if the man said what the Prophet wanted” and the caller continued, “and give me the longing of the pious for that which they long” and the Prophet said, “go Anas, leave the purification water and go to the caller and ask him to make supplication for the Prophet that He aids him with that which He has commissioned him with and ask him to make supplications for the community and that they take that which has been given to them by the Prophet with truth”, so I went to the caller then he said to me, “who has sent you?” so I hated to inform him without taking the permission of the Prophet so I said to him, “with God’s mercy on you why do you need to know?” then he said, “will you not inform me who sent you?” so I went to the Prophet and informed him what the caller said and told me, “tell him you are the messenger of the Prophet so the caller responded after I informed him, “greetings to the Messenger of God and his messenger. I should have gone to him. Send him greetings of peace from me and say to him that al-Khidr sends greetings of peace and he says to you that God has favored you over all the Prophets as He has favored and honored the month of Ramadan over all other months and He has favored your community over all others as He has favored the day of Friday over all other days.” As I got near to the caller I heard him say, “O God make me from amongst this community that has received mercy, is guided, and receives forgiveness.’” Also narrated by Anas who said that the Prophet said, “Al-Khidr is in the seas and Elijah is on land and the two of them gather each night at the dam built by Dhul Qarnayn as a barrier between the people and Gog and Magog. They also both make pilgrimage or they gather each year to drink from Zam Zam enough to last them the following year” Anas added “a third of the well is now gone.” All of this is in regards to what has been transmitted to us regarding al-Khidr. As for what has come to us by way of the reliable jurists, Imam al-Nawawi has said, “as for the story of al-Khidr visiting the Prophet after his death it has been narrated by Imam al-Shafi in his Um with a weak chain of transmission, however he did not mention the name of al-Khidr and rather said the companions heard someone say such and such. The name of al-Khidr was not mentioned by Imam al-Shafi, but rather by some of our fellow jurists who have their own proof texts for adding al-Khidr’s name. The correct opinion (regarding al-Khidr) is that he is alive and this is the opinion of most of the scholars.” Imam al-Ramli was asked about al-Khidr and Elijah upon them both be peace and he answered:As for al-Khidr the correct opinion is that he is a prophet not a saint which is the opinion of the majority of the scholars as al-Khidr said in the Qur’an, “and I did not do it on my own accord” and God’s statement “We bestowed on Him Our mercy” which means revelation and prophecy, not sainthood. This is the case even though some scholars said that he was not a prophet. The correct opinion is that he is alive as Ibn Salah has stated, “the majority of scholars have agreed that he is alive, even the commoners believe in this” and Imam al-Nawawi has stated that “the majority of scholars say that he is alive and living amongst us; this is agreed upon between the Sufis and the pious people as they mention true stories of seeing him in visions, meeting him in waking states, taking knowledge from him, asking him questions, hearing his answers, and his presence at holy locations too many to enumerate”. Therefore the correct opinion is that he is a human and not an angel and his location as well as the location of Elijah is in the land of the Arabs.” From the above it is clear that al-Khidr is a human, is living amongst us, and can meet with people as a miracle for him and the one he is meeting. This should not, however, open the door of those pretenders who claim things that are not true regarding al-Khidr. There is also dispute on his prophethood and the sounder opinion, as stated by Imam al-Ramli, is that he is a prophet. God is most high and all knowledgeable."

    "Question": "Are there differences in the juristic opinions regarding the issue of women’s work outside home? The majority of people in Pakistan are against the concept of working women and believe that the woman should not leave her house.",
    "Answer": "This issue is based on balancing between the advantages and the disadvantages and the matter is left open to the customary practices and the traditions of every country. From the Islamic perspective, the Islamic history along centuries did not have any problems with women working outside their homes. At the Prophet’s time, women paid allegiance and fought side by side with the Prophet in many conquests. Women a long history had a leading role in political, economic, scientific and cultural fields. Lady ‘Aisha was known for her leading opinion and her strong stances against some political issues of her time. During the reign of ‘Umar ibn al Khattab, al Shifaa bint ‘Abdullah was appointed as marketing inspector. Imam al Hafiz ibn Hajar reported that part of his scholarly religious education was conducted by 52 female scholars. The Quran also mentions the story of the Queen of Sheba who led her people to success and victory by her decision of embracing Islam and believing in God with Prophet Solomon."

    "Id": 5847,
    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/5847/amenity-payments-mut‘ah",
    "Question": "I request a fatwa concerning mut‘ah expenses1: its amount, duration, the conditions of receiving it from the husband, its means of payment – bearing in mind that the marriage has lasted for three years – and showing the legal origins for this expense.",
    "Answer": "A divorcée whose valid marriage has been consummated, and whose husband has divorced her without her consent and where she is not its cause, deserves — in addition to her waiting period expenses — a mut‘ah payment equal to at least two years of her typical expenses. This amount takes into consideration the prosperity or poverty of the divorcee, the circumstances for the divorce, and the duration of marriage. It is permitted to allow the divorcee pay the mut‘ah in installments.According to this text, the divorcée’s mut‘ah payment is a sum estimated to equal at least two years of expenses. It is owed to a divorcée whose valid marriage has been consummated, if her husband divorced her without her consent and when she is not the cause. This payment is in addition to her waiting period expenses. The clarificatory notes concerning the mut‘ah payment include: Since the legal norm is that the husband is the one who issues divorce, and that conventional law does not obligate an amenity payment for the divorcée after consummation has occurred, and it suffices her that she is entitled to the total sum of her marriage payment (Ar. mahr) and expenses during the divorce waiting period. But as for an amenity payment: it is recommended but is not required by the courts.In this age the sense of honour has deteriorated and vanished – especially between husband and wife when the bonds of affection between them are broken; divorcées need assistance in dealing with the effects and financial difficulties of divorce, and divorce waiting period expenses do not meet their needs. The mut‘ah payment fulfils these and, indeed, strongly restrains the masses from rushing into divorce.Since the principle behind prescribing mut‘ah is healing and reconciling the divorcée’s broken heart, and consoling her is part of the dignified behaviour recommended by the Sharia‘h – and it is as if it is based on what Allah the Almighty says: Make provision for them, the rich according to his means and the poor according to his - this is a duty for those who do good [2:236]. The mut‘ah payment being obligatory is the opinion of the ‘New’ Shāfi‘ī school, where the payment is obligatory for a divorcée whose marriage has been consummated, and where separation is not by her request nor by her fault. This is one of Imām Ahmad’s opinions, and it is Ibn Taymiyyah’s preference. Its being obligatory is an opinion in the Zāhirī ‘Literalist’ school, and it is Imām Mālik’s opinion.For the reasons listed above, Article 18 was placed to repeat observing guidelines set in the opinions of those Imāms, and it is left to the judge to assess the amount – apart from the previously stated - according to the circumstances of the divorce and to verify that the right is not being abused, and to put it in its proper place if it is. Its assessed amount shall not be less than two years of expenses. To facilitate its payment for the former husband, the article allows for him to pay the prescribed amount in installments.The fact is that using the word ‘nafaqah’ (‘expenses’) to mean ‘mut‘ah’’ (‘amenity payment‘) is a common mistake. Rather, it is just called ‘mut‘ah’, since it is not even included among the various types of expenses. The proof that mut‘ah is obligatory – in addition to what was stated previously in the clarificatory notes – is what Allah the Almighty says: Divorced women shall also have such maintenance as is considered fair: this is a duty for those who are mindful of God. [2:241]The [words] “maintenance” and “duty” are mentioned to emphasise the obligation of the mut‘ah payment. This is in addition to the general phrasing in the verse leading to it being impermissible to restrict its ruling without evidence, and its application to all various types of divorcées: whether or not the marriage is consummated, and whether or not the marriage payment has been determined. The majority of legists consider mut‘ah recommended due to the absence of it being ordered explicitly. Since the clear outcome of examining the legal opinions concerning the lexical denotations of the Qur’anic texts that deal with the amenity payment shows that they differ over the scope of its application, and whether it is obligatory or recommended – due to the speculative nature of the textual denotations – it is permissible for the legal authority to exercise his personal opinion (Ar. ijtihād) in the matter, as a means for organising its rulings with legislation to clarify the basis of it being deserved and to detail the conditions for its being owed, with whatever will lead to uniform application. The conditions for this amenity payment are that the divorcée’s marriage was consummated and valid; she did not consent to the divorce, nor was she its cause. All of these are encompassed within the general boundaries of the Shari‘ah, and do not contradict its lofty goals. From this it is know that: • The minimum duration for the amenity payment is two years, and it has no set maximum. • The circumstances for the divorce, duration of the marriage, and the financial status of the husband are taken into consideration when determining the mut‘ah payment. • Payment can be made in installments, provided it is known to the judge, and delivery must be made under his supervision. This applies when the case has been presented to the courts. When the spouses have reached a settlement and their agreement is governed by contract law."

    "Answer": "It is permissible for an heir or a non-heir to receive a bequest in up to one third of the estate. According to the opinion of some scholars that is chosen for fatwa, it is incumbent to execute a bequest that is made in up to one third of an estate must be. This is the opinion expressed in law no. 71 for the year 1946 CE.The rulingThe fact that your husband notarized the bequest means that it came from a man in full mental capacity and that it is a valid bequest made before witnesses. Therefore, you are entitled to receive the bequeathed property — the apartment and store — provided it is within one third of the estate. This does not eliminate your entitlement to one fourth of your husband's estate (after deducting the bequest) if he does not have a son or to one eighth of the estate (after deducting the bequest) if he has one.

He repeated this on many occasions in public and many of our acquaintances know of it. I used to work and give my earnings to my husband who would put the money in the bank. What is the ruling for this?",
    "Answer": "It is valid to make a bequest to both an heir and a non-heir according to Law no. 71 for the year 1946 CE of the Egyptian bequest law that is itself based on the opinion of some scholars. The bequest is executed from up to one third of the estate without the need to obtain the heirs' consent. Anything in surplus of this requires their consent—if they agree, the will is executed; otherwise it is not. But if only some of the heirs agree, the will is executed from the share of those who consented to the surplus and not from the share of those who did not. This is only applicable if the testator was of sane mind and understood the nature and effect of his testamentary act.The rulingSince the husband's bequest was verbal and no one heard him make it except for his son, then the ruling for it depends on whether the heirs believe it. This is because they are the ones to decide whether it is to be implemented. If the heirs believe the son, then it is obligatory to execute the bequest from one third of the estate and the heirs' consent is not necessary. However, as mentioned above, consent must be obtained for anything in surplus of one third of the estate. If, on the other hand, the heirs do not believe the son, then it is not obligatory to execute the bequest and its implementation is voluntary."

He left a notarized property which he had bequeathed to all of his heirs except one son who, unlike the other heirs, had taken many things from his father during his lifetime.

    "Answer": "It is valid for a person to make a bequest to an heir or to other than an heir in up to one third of his estate according to the opinion of some scholars chosen for fatwa and the opinion implemented in courts.It is permissible to make a bequest in up to more than one third of an estate though the will is not executable except with the consent of rest of the heirs.The rulingIf the property is from one third of the estate, then it exclusively belongs to those to whom it was bequeathed with the exception of the debarred son. But if it makes up more than one third of the bequest, then it is mandatorily executable in up to one third of the estate's value and not in the surplus except with the consent of all of the heirs provided they:- Are adult;- Sane;- Do not dispose of their property under duress;- Are knowledgeable of what they are authorizing.If some of the heirs but not all consent to the surplus, the excess portion is executable from the share of those who consented and not from the share of the others.The above answers the question and Allah the Almighty knows best."

In Surat al-Isra`, He says, We have honored the sons of Adam; provided them with transport on land and sea; given them for sustenance things good and pure; and conferred upon them special favors, above a great part of Our creation.[Al-Israa`, 70]The Prophet considered the violation of a dead body as tantamount to violating a living person; he said, \"Breaking the bones of a deceased is tantamount to breaking the bones of a living person\" [Recorded by Abu Dawud]. This hadith demonstrates that there is a certain sanctity for dead bodies just as there is for living people. Furthermore, the Prophet prohibited against treading on graves; he said, \"It is better if I were to walk on hot coal, a sword or mend my shoes with my feet than to walk on a grave\" [Recorded by Ibn Majah with a good ascription]. Abu Marthad al-Ghanwi narrated that the Prophet said, \"Do not sit on graves and do not pray in their direction\" [Muslim].The rulingIt is known that whatever leads to a prohibition is itself prohibited. Based on this, it is impermissible to build a grave beneath a walkway. Moreover, the road is public property and not just for the owner of the tomb; it is therefore impermissible for the latter to use the road for his own interests. As for the bodies which were previously interred, you can make multiple levels inside a single grave in such a manner that each body is buriedseparately.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/4817/burying-males-and-females-in-a-single-grave",
    "Question": "Is it permissible to bury males and females in a single grave?",
    "Answer": "There is a scholarly consensus on the impermissibility of burying more than one individual in a single grave unless [absolutely] necessary, as when there is insufficient space [in the graveyard], the absence of someone capable of digging a grave, or when another one is not available. The Messenger of Allah and his Companions were accustomed to burying each individual separately except out of a necessity.When a necessity exists, the most meritorious is buried first facing the qibla [En. direction of prayer] followed by the next in the degree of merit and according to the order of preference concerning the imamate [En. leading others in prayer]. This is because of the hadith narrated by Jabir who said: We complained to the Messenger of Allah on the day of Uhud and said: \"O Messenger of Allah! It is a hardship upon us to dig a grave for every [dead] person!\" So the Messenger of Allah said: \"Dig deep, dig well, and bury two or three persons in a single grave\". They said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Whom should we bury first?\" He replied: \"Bury the one who memorized Qur`an the most\". Jabir said: \"My father was the third of three to be buried in the same grave\" [Bukhari and others]. A wall of earth is made as a barrier between two individuals buried in the same grave. A father is buried before his son out of respect, even if the son were more meritorious; a mother is buried before her daughter; women must not be buried in the same grave with men unless this is confirmed to be a necessity and on the condition of making a barrier of earth between them; a male is buried before a female, even if he were her son, and a male is placed at the head of the grave and the female at the foot.Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "n on the Jama'at al-Tableegh founded by sheikh Mohammed Ilyas? He addressed a letter to his sect in which he said: &quot;If Allah does not desire someone to do a certain act, then even the prophets would not be able to do it even if they exert their utmost effort. And if Allah desires the weak, like you, to do what the prophets were unable to do, then you will do it.

Sheikh Mohammed Ilyas wants his sect to do what the prophets were unable to, [basically] diminishing the rights of the prophets, peace and blessings be upon them, and sender, Allah Almighty!<br />\r\nThe second letter likewise diminishes the rights of the prophets and slanders them <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>",
    "Answer": "Students of knowledge must distance themselves from the methodologies of those who accuse others of disbelief and the movements of those who accuse others of introducing innovations in religion, immorality and misguidance that have become so prevalent at present. They must also observe the ethics of disagreement with their fellow Muslims and must not allow that such differences to become a pretext for accusing them with deviating from Islam. This is among the excesses due to disagreement and which the prophet maintained was one of the characteristics of hypocrisy. 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him narrated that the prophet said: \"Whosoever has (the following) four traits is a hypocrite and whosoever has just one possesses one of the characteristics of hypocrisy until he gives it up: If he is entrusted, he proves to be treacherous, if he makes a promise he breaks it, if he makes a covenant he proves to be deceitful, and if he quarrels he behaves impudently in an insulting manner [Bukhari and Muslim].There is a difference between those who contravene the methods of da'wa [En. calling to the way of Allah] and between accusing a fellow Muslim of immorality, deviating from the path of Allah and sometimes even disbelief as is the case with many of today's sects. The former is plausible and acceptable and arises from the diversity in human nature while Allah forbids the latter:Do not quarrel with one another, or you may lose heart and your spirit may desert you [Al-Anfal, 46].The prophet [pbuh] warned against accusing a fellow Muslim of disbelief and said; \"There is none who accuses his fellow Muslim of immorality and unbelief but would carry its sin [if were otherwise]\" [Reported by Bukahri from a narration by Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him].\"If a person accuses his fellow Muslim with unbelief, one of the two deserves the name\" [Reported by Muslim from a narration by 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both].The principle in interpreting the words and actions of another Muslim is that they must be construed as not contravening the principle of Tawheed [En. Monotheism]; it is impermissible to initiate accusations of unbelief or shirk [En. Associating partners with God and this contravenes the belief of Muslims. What is your opinion on this matter?Allah] since the religion of a Muslim is strong evidence for his belief in Allah. This is a general principle which Muslims must implement. On this issue, imam Malik said: \"If there are 99 reasons that justify that the actions of a Muslim entail unbelief, and at the same time there is only one reason that justifies that he is a Muslim, then we must say that he is a Muslim because of that single reason.\" A Muslim believes that 'Isa, may the blessings of Allah be upon him, resurrects the dead with the permission and power of Allah. A Christian on the other hand believes that 'Isa resurrected the dead through his own power and that he is God, the son of God, or one of the Holy Trinity. Therefore, if we hear a Muslim say, \"I believe that 'Isa resurrected the dead\" and a Christian make the same statement, we must not think that the Muslim has become a Christian, but must construe the statement in an appropriate manner due to his affiliation to Islam and the doctrine of Tawheed. A Muslim likewise believes that a person must worship Allah alone while a mushrik believes in the permissibility of worshipping other than Allah Almighty. If we see among the actions of a Muslim what may be construed to entail shirk or otherwise, we must then construe his actions as being in line with Islam and under its rubric. This is because the belief of a person whose Islam has been ascertained with proof, cannot be removed by doubt and conjecture. If this concerns the general public of Muslims, what then of the person whose belief is not only known to be firm, but has been established through previous actions, calling to the way of Allah, urging Muslims to adhere to their religion and to the way of their prophet, peace and blessings be upon him?!The words of sheikh Mohammed Ilyas mentioned in the question fall under what we have mentioned above. The statement he is reported to have said: \"If Allah does not desire someone to do a certain act, then even the prophets would not be able to do it even if they exert their utmost efforts\" is consistent with the Islamic creed that nothing ever happens in the universe except with the will of Allah. Allah says:But you will only wish to do so if God wills—God is all knowing, all wise [Al-Insan, 30].The rest of the statement, \"And if Allah desires the weak, like you, to do what the prophets were unable to, then you will do it. Therefore, you must do what is demanded of you and do not heed your weakness\", this is likewise construed according to the rational probability that comes under the Divine Power and not according to hear say. Even if we assume that it is true, this does not necessarily mean that such a person is better than the prophets because virtue does not necessarily mean preference. In the same vein, the jihad of the companions of the prophet is a virtue that was not accorded to other prophets. In spite of this, the prophets are better than the companions. Sheikh Mohammed Ilyas did not say that a person whom Allah permits to do what he did not permit the prophets is better than them. How can his words be interpreted as disparaging the prophets and questioning the wisdom of Allah in His choice of prophets? These statements are refuted for the following reasons:1- The person who reported these words did not say that the duties that Allah did not allow the prophets to do are the same as those He entrusted to them.2- Even if it were thus, and the duties that Allah did not allow the prophets to do are the same as those He entrusted to them, this does not depreciate the Divine will or the [status] of the prophets. There is a difference between universal will and the legitimate will. Allah may command a person to do something but does not will it to happen for a certain wisdom only He knows. To illustrate this point, let us use the example of Adam. Allah commanded Adam, peace be upon him, to abstain from eating from the prohibited tree. But Adam disobeyed and ate from it. He commanded Abraham, peace be upon him, to slaughter his son but did not will allow it to happen. Not differentiating between the universal will and the legitimate will is the position of the Mu'tazila—it is an innovation that contravenes the Qur`an, sunnah, and the consensus of the pious predecessors from among the Muslim community.3- Allah Almighty is not obligated to do anything, but does what He wills and decrees what He wants. It is impermissible for anyone to declare that if the prophets had not done something then Allah will not let anyone else succeed in doing it, while it is not necessarily a rational or legitimate impossibility.4- It is out of impudence and disrespect to accuse the prophets of being unqualified to convey the message of Allah for failing to do some of the things which they were commanded to do. The accomplished scholars maintain that the prophets were either experiencing extenuating circumstances or that the command of Allah was not obligatory in their regard.Sheikh Mohammed Ilyas' other statement: \"We bring glad tidings and a true promise to the people of the last age that the reward of each one of them is like the reward of fifty of the companions of the prophet [pbuh]\" is consistent with the words of the prophet [pbuh] as stated in an authentic hadith. Abu Umayya al-Sha'bani, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"I approached abu al-Khashni, may Allah be pleased with him, and said, 'What do you make of this verse?' He said, 'Which verse?' I said, 'the words of Allah 'You who believe, you are responsible for your own souls; if anyone else goes astray it will not harm you as long as you follow the guidance [Al-Ma`ida, 105].' He said, 'By Allah! I asked an expert on it—I asked the messenger of Allah [pbuh] and he said, 'Follow the command to do what is right and the command to forsake what is evil even if you see a miser being obeyed, people following their own inclinations, or that the life of this world leading where it would, and every person taking pride in his own opinion. You must be responsible for your own soul and do not mind others because you will experience days in which patience is like holding hot coal—when the reward of good deeds equals the reward of 50 men making the same [good] deeds as you.' Someone said, 'O messenger of Allah! The reward of 50 of us or of them?' The prophet answered, 'No, 50 of you' \" [Reported by abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi. Al-Tirmidhi declared it fair and ibn Habban declared it authentic. This hadith has many chains of transmission]. How then can the latter statement be misconstrued and Sheikh Ilyas accused of disparaging the prophets being disrespectsful to them and violating the Muslim creed when it is consistent with the words of the prophet [pbuh]!Those who love to argue must be beware of criticizing the words of the prophet [pbuh] without comprehension or even being aware of it. There is no doubt that increasing one's reward does not necessitate absolute preference. Companionship of the prophet is an unparalleled virtue and comparing between the rewards of acts is by weighing equal deeds. Companionship of the prophet is unparalleled—its virtue is like no other.Muslims must fear Allah Almighty concerning their fellow Muslims. Their different opinions must not lead to disputes or hurling accusations of unbelief and immorality and disobedience. It is impermissible for a Muslim to occupy himself with revealing the weaknesses of a fellow Muslim and fishing for the faults of others. This is warless jihad, the reason behind division among Muslims and a waste of efforts. Such conduct would preoccupy us from building our societies and uniting our community.'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him said; \"The prophet [pbuh] ascended the pulpit and said in a loud voice, 'O you who have proclaim your faith with your tongues but not with your hearts! Do not hurt Muslims and insult them nor reveal their weaknesses. Whosoever reveals the weakness of a fellow Muslim, Allah will reveal his own weaknesses, And whosoever Allah reveals his weaknesses, he will expose him even if he were at the center of the his house.' \"We ask Allah Almighty Muslims adhere to the Quran and sunna and the proper understanding of religion and knowledge. Amen.Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "What is the ruling for granting a monetary prize and an award of merit to a person who insults and vilifies prophet Mohammed [pbuh] and Islam? In his published books he:",
    "Answer": "It is a fact in Islamic law that venerating the Shari'ah [En. Islamic law], religion and the status of the Prophet [PBUH] are among the greatest pillars of Islam and one of its most important duties.The following verses from the Qur'an illustrate this:Whoever honors the symbols of Allah - indeed, it is from the piety of hearts [Al-Hajj, 32].Indeed, We have sent you as a witness, a bringer of good tidings and a warner. That you [people] may believe in Allah and His Messenger and honor him, respect the Prophet and exalt Allah morning and afternoon [Al-Fath, 8-9].Indeed, those who abuse Allah and His Messenger - Allah has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter and prepared for them a humiliating punishment [Al-Ahzab, 57].[People], do not call upon the Messenger's as you call one another—God is well aware of those of you who steal away surreptiously—and those who go against His order should beware lest a trial afflict them or they receive a painful punishment [Al-Nur,63].There is a consensus among Muslims that defaming Islam and insulting the prophet puts the perpetrator beyond the pale of Islam and the community. Such a person is blameworthy in this life and deserves punishment in the Hereafter.Article 98 (w) of the penal law criminalizes slandering heavenly religions or any of their sects and harming national unity or social peace. In reference to the question, the texts mentioned in the question are blasphemous and put their writer beyond the pale of Islam if he is a Muslim. If they are confirmed, these erroneous and vile claims are worthy of being criminalized and not honored. It is obligatory to take all the legal and penal measures against such a person to prevent his evil from spreading. [It is important] to set him up as an example for whoever is lured by Satan into wrongdoing. Allah the Almighty said: Say, [O Muhammad], \"Shall we inform you of the greatest losers as to [their] deeds? [They are] those whose effort is lost in worldly life, while they think that they are doing well in work [Al-Kahf, 103-104].If the prize award committee is aware of the contents of his books, then it must give back the value of the prize which taken from Muslim funds.And Allah knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/4806/how-can-a-muslim-establish-a-true-belief-in-the-messengers-of-god",
    "Question": "How can a Muslim establish a true belief in the Messengers of God?",
    "Answer": "Belief in the Messengers is one of the pillars of faith. It means that Muslims believe that God did not leave creation to their own devices, rather He cared for their needs and sent revelations to people at every time and place. It also means that the Prophet Muhammad is the seal of the prophets and there is no prophet after him. This is a general response.As for particulars, Muslims believe in the Messengers mentioned in the Quran. Their number is twenty-five, eighteen of whom God mentioned in Chapter 6 of the Quran, That is Our argument. We gave it unto Abraham against his folk. We raise unto degrees of wisdom whom We will. Lo! thy Lord is Wise, Aware. And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob; each of them We guided; and Noah did We guide aforetime; and of his seed (We guided) David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the good And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias. Each one (of them) was of the righteous. And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot. Each one (of them) did We prefer above (Our) creatures, [6:83-86]. The remaining seven are, Muhammad, Adam, Hud, Salih, Dhu al-Kefl, Shu’ayb, and Idris whom God has mentioned in Quran, Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the messenger of God and the Seal of the Prophets; and God is ever Aware of all things [33:40]; And He taught Adam all the names, then showed them to the angels, saying: Inform Me of the names of these, if ye are truthful. They said: Be glorified! We have no knowledge saving that which Thou hast taught us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower, the Wise. He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names, and when he had informed them of their names, He said: Did I not tell you that I know the secret of the heavens and the earth? And I know that which ye disclose and which ye hide [2:31-33]; Then Adam received from his Lord words (of revelation), and He relented toward him. Lo! He is the relenting, the Merciful [2:37]. Dhu al-Kefl was mentioned in two places in the Quran, And (mention) Ishmael, and Idris, and Dhu’l-Kifl. All were of the steadfast [21:85]; And make mention of Ishmael and Elisha and Dhu’l-Kifl. All are of the chosen [38:48]. He mentioned Idris in more than one place in the Quran including, And make mention in the Scripture of Idris. Lo! he was a saint, a prophet; And We raised him to high station [19:56-57].God also mention Hud in the Quran in more than one place including, And unto (the tribe of) A’ad (We sent) their brother, Hud. He said: O my people! Serve Allah. Ye have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil)? [7:65]. Salih is mentioned in more than one place in the Quran including, And We verily sent unto Thamud their brother Salih, saying: Worship Allah. And lo! they (then became two parties quarrelling [27:45]. God mentioned Shu’ayb in more than one place in the Quran including, And unto Madian (We sent) their brother Shu’eyb. He said: O my people! Serve Allah. Ye have no other God save Him! And give not short measure and short weight. Lo! I see you well-to-do, and lo! I fear for you the doom of a besetting Day [11:84].Those are the ones that are mentioned in the Quran, and Muslims must believe in them specifically, meaning that Muslims should not deny the prophethood of any one of them. Muslims must also believe that God sent prophets other than those mentioned and that their actual number is greater, Verily We sent messengers before thee, among them those of whom We have told thee, and some of whom We have not told thee; and it was not given to any messenger that he should bring a portent save by God’s leave, but when God’s commandment cometh (the cause) is judged aright, and the followers of vanity will then be lost [40:78]. The Prophet said, “I am the seal of one thousand or more prophets. No prophet has ever been sent except that he warned his community of the dajjal.” According to Abu Dharr he asked the Prophet, “O Mesenger of God, how many prophets are there?” The Prophet said, “One hundred thousand prophets, and one hundred and twenty four prophets.” I asked, “How many of them are messengers?” He said, “Three hundred and thirteen.” Just as Muslims were asked to believe in the divinely revealed books, the same request applies to the belief in the prophets. It is not permissible for Muslims to depart from following the |Prophet Muhammad and follow another one. Muslims’ faith in the prophets is that they believe that God sent them to their communities and commanded their communities to follow them. Thus it is not permissible for us to follow them for the same two reasons provided above regarding the divinely revealed books, namely: we cannot be sure that what has been related concerning them in the books of other peoples has not been altered. Even if what has been related concerning them has not been altered, it is not permissible for us to follow them because God has abrogated following them when He sent the Prophet Muhammad, the Seal who said, “I have brought it to you white and pure, and if Moses were alive he would have followed me.” What has been mentioned is the summary of the belief of Muslims regarding the messengers. We ask God to provide us with true faith and good works, and our final prayer is, all praise is to God, Lord of the Worlds.And God is Most High and knows best."

    "Link": "/en/fatwa/details/4805/how-should-muslims-believe-in-the-angels",
    "Question": "How should Muslims believe in the angels?",
    "Answer": "Muslims must believe in the blessed angels and know that they are God’s creation. Muslims believe in the existence of angels, and they believe in what is related in the shari’ah concerning their names, like Jibril [Gabriel]: Say (O Muhammad, to mankind): Who is an enemy to Gabriel! For he it is who has revealed (this Scripture) to your heart by God’s leave, confirming that which was (revealed) before it, and a guidance and glad tidings to believers; Who is an enemy to God, and His angels and His messengers, and Gabriel and Michael! Then, lo! God (Himself) is an enemy to the disbelievers [2:97-98]. And He said to the wives of the Prophet who rebelled against him, If you two turn unto God repentant, (you have cause to do so) for your hearts desired (the ban); and if you aid one another against him (Muhammad) then lo! God, even He, is his Protecting Friend, and Gabriel and the righteous among the believers; and furthermore the angels are his helpers [66:4]. And our Lord mentioned the Angel of Death in the Qur’an saying, Say: The angel of death, who has charge concerning you, will gather you, and afterward unto your Lord you will be returned [32:11]. And our Lord mentioned the gatekeeper of the Hellfire and mentioned his name, which is Malik, And they cry: O master! Let your Lord make an end of us. He says: Lo! here you must remain [43:77]. And He mentioned the angels of the Hellfire saying, Ah, what will convey unto you what that burning is! - It leaves naught; it spares naught. It shrivels the man. Above it are nineteen. We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and their number have We made to be a stumbling-block for those who disbelieve; that those to whom the Scripture has been given may have certainty, and that believers may increase in faith; and that those to whom the Scripture has been given and believers may not doubt; and that those in whose hearts there is disease, and disbelievers, may say: What does God mean by this similitude ? Thus God sends astray whom He will, and whom He will He guides. None knowes the hosts of thy Lord save Him. This is naught else than a Reminder unto mortals [74:27-31]. There are different orders of angels that have been mentioned in the authentic prophetic tradition that are not mentioned in the Quran and must be believed in as well. Examples of these are the angle of mercy and the blower of spirits. The Prophet said, “Your creation comes together in your mother’s womb in forty days. Then it is a clot for a similar period. Then it is a lump of flesh for a similar period. God sends an angel to it to blow into it the spirit and to command four things: its sustenance, its life span, its deeds, and whether it will have good or bad destiny. I swear by He other than Whom there is no divinity, one of you may do the works of the people of Paradise until there is but an arm’s length between them, then destiny will catch up with him and he will end with the works of the people of Hell and enter it. And a man may do the works of the people of Hell until there is but an arm’s length between them, then destiny will catch up with him and he will end with the works of the people of Paradise and enter it.” Angels must be believed in in general, and particularly those about whom God has taught us and particularly those that God has made known in detail as has been mentioned in the preceding texts and others. Belief in the angels has a tremendous effect on the believer’s being elevated to reach his Lord; feeling the existence of blessed creatures around him makes him constantly shy away from disobedience. And our final prayer is “All praise is due to God, Lord of the Worlds.”"

    "Question": "Can I celebrate my birthday?",
    "Answer": "In Islam, there is no legal impediment which hinders you from celebrating birthdays as it is part of reminding ourselves with the blessing of existence and creation. This meaning does not contradict with the hadith which Anas ibn Malik narrated in which the Prophet was coming to Medinah and realized that people had two days in which they play and express joy so he asked “what are those days?” and people said “we used to play and have fun in these two days in the pre Islamic period” so the Prophet said “God has replaced those days with better ones, the day of Adha and the day of Fitr”. Therefore the only two feasts which Muslims celebrate are the day of Adha (sacrifice) and the day of Fitr (breaking the fast) but that does not mean at all that one should not celebrate birthdays and other special occasions in one’s life such as wedding anniversary, birthdays etc.. as long as we don’t name these occasions as celebrations or feasts. Also in all cases in celebrating different occasions, we should refrain from committing all kinds of prohibitions. Birthdays fall under God’s commands in which He says, “and remind them of the days of God” 14:5 and among the days of God are birthdays and the days of victory."

    "Question": " where we have some people who call themselves &quot;Ahl al-Qur`an wal-Hadith&quot; and &quot;Ahl at-Tawhid&quot;. They adopt the following principles:<br />\r\nThey do not acknowledge ijma' (scholarly consensus) and qiyas (analogy).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">They maintain the impermissibility of taqlid (following any of the four followed schools of jurisprudence or others) and insist that ijtihad (independent interpretation of legal sources) is mandatory upon every individual, even those who do not speak the Arabic language.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">They do not consider that the words of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) constitute binding legal evidence, alleging that the Companions contravened the Qur`an and sunnah.</p>",
    "Answer": "These invalid opinions cannot be attributed to the Sunnis: neither to the Ahl al-Hadith, nor the Ahl al-Ra`y nor any other recognized Islamic school of jurisprudence.Ijma'Muslim scholars are unanimous that ijma' amounts to uncontestable definitive proof; it is part of what constitutes the identity of Islam, often referred to as 'categorically established religious doctrines' and is substantiated by the words of Allah,If anyone opposes the Messenger, after guidance has been made clear to him, and follows a path other than that of the believers, We shall leave him on his chosen path—We shall burn him in Hell, an evil destination. [An-Nisaa`, 4:115]Further evidence can be found in numerous reports from the Prophet , transmitted through multiple sources stating that the Islamic community will never agree upon an error.QiyasNotable scholars have agreed on the bindingness of qiyas when its conditions are met as expounded in the books of principles of jurisprudence. Some scholars even went as far as issue a verdict that if an endowment is established for scholars, its beneficiaries may not include those of them who deny qiyas.IjtihadIt is absurd and irrational to maintain that ijtihad is obligatory upon all Muslims, even those ignorant of the Arabic language, and to prohibit following the four schools of jurisprudence. Asking a layman to make ijtihad is tantamount to asking him to undertake an impossible task. If they then add to this the prohibition of following the four schools of jurisprudence, the meaning of this would be to destroy the principles of Islam in the name of Islam, and to forfeit the sunnah with the claim of adhering to it. Under such circumstances, scholars must intervene to suppress the blind and divisive propagation of such corrupt opinions. Adherents of these positions, who are sincere in their desire to attain the pleasure of Allah, would surely abandon their false beliefs if they knew the truth of the matter and the consequences of their beliefs.The opinions of the CompanionsThe probity of the opinions of the Companions when they differ is a point of scholarly disagreement, as is mentioned in the books of jurisprudence. A Muslim must, however, observe the requisite etiquette with the Companions of the Messenger since it is they whom Allah has chosen to be the Companions of the best of creation, Prophet Mohammed and it is they who conveyed Islam and Islamic law. It is therefore disrespectful to accuse them of deliberately contravening the Qur`an and sunnah. One must think well of them and say, \"This was the extent of so-and-so's knowledge\" or \"maybe he did not learn of this hadith\" or \"maybe he did not consider this hadith authentic.\"A Muslim who loves Allah and His Messenger and is keen to follow true Islam, must not take religion from any arbitrary person nor listen to anyone who lacks the requisite knowledge to formulate opinions in matters of Islamic law. Imam Mohammed Ibn Sirin (may Allah have mercy upon him) said, \"This knowledge is religion, so be careful from whom you take your religion.\"Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Question": " is the creed of ahlussunnah waljama&rsquo;t in respect of where is God? Is he on his throne? Or is he present every where in every thing?<br />\r\nIt is established in Muslim creed that God Almighty is not contained by space (the throne or otherwise) nor confined in time since both time and place are His creations and God cannot be contained by any of His creation. God is the Creator of everything and the all Encompassing. The throne is created by His power as are the angels carrying it. Muslims unanimously agree upon this without a shadow of a doubt and scholars expressed this by saying, &quot;God was there in absence of all else and He is now as He was before&rdquo;</p>",
    "Answer": "Scholarly quotes on God Almighty• Imam Ja`far As-Sadiq (peace be upon him) said: \"Whoever claims that God is contained in anything, or originated from anything, or is borne by anything has associated partners with Him. If He was in something, then He would be contained; and if He was on something, then He would be borne; and if He was from something, then He would have a beginning.\"• It was said to Yahya ibn Mu'adh al-Razi: \"Tell us about God the Exalted!\" Yahya replied: \"He is one god.\" The inquirer asked: \"What is He like?\" Yahya replied: \"He is The Ever-Sovereign, The Ever-Powerful.\" The inquirer asked: \"Where is He?\" Yahya replied: \"He is ever Watchful.\" Thereupon, the inquirer said: \"I was not asking about this!\" Yahya said: \"Other than this would be an attribute of [His] creatures; as for the attribute of God, it is as I told you.\"• Dhul Nun al-Misri was asked about the words of God 'Ar-Rahmanu `ala al-`arshistawa (The Most Merciful is firmly established on the Throne [Ta-Ha; 5])'. He answered: \"He affirmed His existence and denied containment in space. He exists independently; everything else exists by His Wisdom and as He Wills.\"The textual evidences mentioned in the Qur'an and Sunna on the exaltedness of God Almighty over His creation refer to His Sublime status, Sovereignty, and dominance and power over them. God Almighty transcends His creation i.e. He is free from any resemblance to [His] creatures. His attributes are not like theirs—they are free from imperfection and to Him belongs the perfect attributes and the most beautiful Names. God is beyond anything one can ever imagine. The realization of the inability to understand the nature of God is in itself knowledge of Him and to inquire into His nature is associating partners with Him.Al-Qadi 'Iyad said: \"There is a consensus among Muslims: their scholars, orators, scholars of hadith, mujtahideen [those who independently derive rulings from legal texts] and those who follow them that the verses mentioning God's existence in the heavens are interpreted figuratively.\" Such verses include:Do you feel secure that He who [holds authority] in the heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you [al-Mulk: 16].If we were asked about God's place we would say that there is nothing whatsoever like Him as God Himself says in His Book:There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing. [Ash-Shura: 11]One must not occupy oneself with pondering over the nature of God; this is a great danger as it will lead to drawing analogies between God and His creation. What we must do, is ponder on the signs of God's Might and Greatness hence, strengthening our belief in Him."

    "Question": "s (non-Muslims)? What is the ruling of being friend with non-Muslim without the intention of inviting him or her to Islam? Just being friend with non-Muslims?</p>",
    "Answer": "Permissibility of dealing with non-MuslimsMaintaining ties, giving gifts, visiting and congratulating non-Muslims are all from among kind treatment. God the Almighty commands us to speak kind words to everyone alike. He says, Speak fair to people. (Al-Baqarah, 83). God also commands us to always be kind to others. He says, God commands justice and the doing of good. [An-Nahl, 90)God does not forbid us from maintaining good ties with non-Muslims, exchanging gifts or from other acts of kind treatment. God the Almighty says, God forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for (your) faith nor derive you out of your homes from dealing kindly and justly with them: for God loves those who are just. [Al-Mumtahana, 8)The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his family) accepted the gifts of non-Muslims It is established through authentic mutawatir hadiths that the Prophet (pbuh) accepted the gifts of non-Muslims. He accepted the gift of Al-Muqawqis, the great ruler of Coptic Egypt. Ali ibn Abu Talib (may God be pleased with him) reported that Chosroes, Caesar, and other kings sent gifts to the Prophet (pbuh) and he accepted them. (Recorded by Ahmed in his Musnad and At-Tirmidhi in his Sunan)Scholars of Islam understood from these hadiths the permissibility or recommendation of accepting gifts from non-Muslims because it is an act of benevolence. Commenting on the gifts the Prophet (pbuh) offered non-Muslims, Al-Sarkhasi said, \"Offering gifts to others is from among good morals as per the words of the Prophet (pbuh), “I was sent to establish good manners.” Therefore, scholars understood that exchanging gifts is recommended among Muslims and non-Muslims alike. (Sharh Al-Siyar Al-Kabir, vol. 1, p. 96)In Al-Fatawa Al-Hindiya, it is mentioned that Mohammed Ibn Al-Hassan (may God have mercy on him) said, \"There is no harm in visiting and hosting Ahl Al-Dhimma [non-Muslims coexisting peacefully with Muslims] even if they are merely acquaintances. Likewise, there is no harm in a Muslim visiting a non-Muslim whether or not they are close or coexist in peace.\" (Al-Fatawa Al-Hindiya, vol. 5, p. 34) In Fath Al-'Ali Al-Malik (vol. 2, p. 349), Sheikh 'Ilish was asked whether congratulating non-Muslims is considered apostasy. He replied, \"Congratulating a non-Muslim by wishing him a long life is not considered apostasy since it does not imply venerating or admitting disbelief.\"RulingThrough the above mentioned noble verses, ahadith and scholarly opinions, it is evident that there is no doubt that maintaining ties with non-Muslims by exchanging visits, offering condolences and good wishes, exchanging gifts and the like are from among kind treatment. This is considered one of the ways towards calling to the religion of God through noble manners. God the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "e in Edmonton, Alberta in Canada who tells people in the Sunni mosques that the Shi&rsquo;tes are disbelievers and he is keen to drive people away from dealing with Shi&rsquo;tes. Is his behavior right? And are the Shi&rsquo;tes really disbelievers?</p>",
    "Answer": "What the Imam says is not true and this kind of generalization in judging a sect is not one of the methodologies of the people of the Sunnah. It is not right to pass judgments on all Shi’tes because of some old writings and books which might insinuate disbelief. The fact is that not all Shi’tes believe in these books as a lot of them either reinterpret or totally reject such writings. There is a big difference between judging a person through his beliefs or through his lived reality and between judging a person through some old books relevant to his sect without knowing his position on them. The original state of matters is thinking well of Muslims and the general legal maxim asserts that if a person embraces Islam with certitude, his faith is not relinquished without certitude. This kind of reckless behavior and general judgments do not fit those who chose to be in the frontline in the advocacy for Islam especially in non Muslim countries.Muslim Imams should focus on advocating brotherhood and unity among Muslims as this is the right methodology which serves the best interest of Islam. The Imam also should be cautious not build a blockade between God and people through disseminating distorting images of disunity and discord in the Muslim ummah. The true Muslim should follow the school of the people of the Sunnah without casting the shadows of disbelief on other theological schools especially when there are no supporting evidences and no interest in judging them with disbelief."

    "Question": "vealed by God?</p>",
    "Answer": "Our belief in the divinely revealed books is one of the pillars of our faith; without it a Muslim’s faith is not valid. The divinely revealed books are a manifestation of God’s care for humanity, and His Lordship over creation. Our Lord revealed books to us and commanded His Messengers to convey them, and it is Muslims’ responsibility to believe in the divinely revealed books on a whole. Muslims must believe that God revealed books to humanity that make Him known to them and teach them how to worship Him. Our Lord revealed the Quran to Muhammad, and before that He revealed other books, He hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture with truth, confirming that which was (revealed) before it, even as He revealed the Torah and the Gospel [3:3]. Muslims must believe in the information that the divine law has provided concerning these previous revelations. Muslims believe that God revealed pages to Abraham and that He revealed the tablets and the Torah to Moses, Lo! This is in the former scrolls. The Books of Abraham and Moses [87:18-19]; Or hath he not had news of what is in the books of Moses. And Abraham who paid his debt [53:36-37]; Hath there not come unto them the proof of what is in the former scriptures? [20:133]. We also believe that God revealed everything to Moses in the Tablets, He said: O Moses! I have preferred thee above mankind by My messages and by My speaking (unto thee). So hold that which I have given thee, and be among the thankful. And We wrote for him, upon the tablets, the lesson to be drawn from all things and the explanation of all things, then (bade him): Hold it fast; and command thy people (saying): Take the better (course made clear) therein. I shall show thee the abode of evil-livers [7:144-145]; Again, We gave the Scripture unto Moses, complete for him who would do good, an explanation of all things, a guidance and a mercy, that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord [6:154]; We gave unto Moses the Scripture, and We appointed it a guidance for the children of Israel, saying: Choose no guardian beside Me [17:2].We also believe that God revealed the Zabur to David, And thy Lord is Best Aware of all who are in the heavens and the earth. And we preferred some of the prophets above others, and unto David We gave the Psalms [17:55]; Lo! We inspire thee as We inspired Noah and the prophets after him, as We inspired Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and as We imparted unto David the Psalms [6:163].And we believe that God revealed the Injil to Jesus son of Mary, And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him the Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was (revealed) before it in the Torah - a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off (evil) [5:46]; When Allah saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favour unto thee and unto thy mother; how I strengthened thee with the holy Spirit, so that thou spakest unto mankind in the cradle as in maturity; and how I taught thee the Scripture and Wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel [5:110].Muslims believe that God revealed pages to Abraham, the Torah to Moses, the Psalms to David, and the Bible Injil to Jesus. Muslims do not deny or affirm the names of any books revealed to the prophets without being informed about them by a legal text. Muslims do not believe that these books have been entirely preserved by God along the years or that they include a law that is to be followed by Muslims for two reasons:The first is that God has not mentioned that He has preserved these books until now, rather He has mentioned that the Jews altered them, and these books were, before the coming of Islam were revealed to the Jews. Therefore woe be unto those who write the Scripture with their hands and then say, \"This is from Allah,\" that they may purchase a small gain therewith. Woe unto them for that their hands have written, and woe unto them for that they earn thereby [2:79]; And because of their breaking their covenant, We have cursed them and made hard their hearts. They change words from their context and forget a part of that whereof they were admonished [5:13]; Have ye any hope that they will be true to you when a party of them used to listen to the word of Allah, then used to change it, after they had understood it, knowingly?[2:75]; Say O People of the Scripture! Ye have naught (of guidance) till ye observe the Torah and the Gospel and that which was revealed unto you from your Lord. That which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) from thy Lord is certain to increase the contumacy and disbelief of many of them. But grieve not for the disbelieving folk [5:68].The second is that even if they did still exist without having been altered, the Quran has hegemony over them and abrogates acting according to them, And unto thee have We revealed the Scripture with the truth, confirming whatever Scripture was before it, and a watcher over it. So judge between them by that which Allah hath revealed, and follow not their desires away from the truth which hath come unto thee [5:48]; Follow that which is inspired in thee from thy Lord; there is no God save Him; and turn away from the idolaters [6:106]; And this is a blessed Scripture which We have revealed. So follow it and ward off (evil), that ye may find mercy [6:155]; (Saying): Follow that which is sent down unto you from your Lord, and follow no protecting friends beside Him. Little do ye recollect! [7:3].Based on the preceding we can summarize that Muslims believe in the divinely revealed books in general, and particularly we believe that those that have been mentioned in the sources of our tradition were revealed to those specific prophets. Muslims do not, however, follow these books due to the reasons mentioned above. Muslims believe in the Quran and follow it because it is the final word of God to humanity; there is nothing that will abrogate or respond to it. And all Praise is to God Lord of the Worlds, and God is most high and knows best."

    "Question": " who embraced Islam not long ago and since then I keep praying regularly and fast the month of Ramadan and it just happened that for reasons that are solely related to my feelings towards my husband that I prostrated before him without being aware of it and without knowing the juristic ruling on it. I later knew that prostrating to anyone or thing except God is an act of polytheism which drives the person out of Islam and therefore he or she has to reenter Islam again. I really don&rsquo;t know what to do? Did I commit a sin? Please help me.</p>",
    "Answer": "No dear sister, you did not lose your faith or religion by prostrating before your husband because faith is a solid conviction that resides in the heart and you can’t lose your faith unless you change your theological conviction through disbelieving in the Oneness of God, the lord of the worlds and the prophethood of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) who is the seal of all prophets and the last divine link between heaven and earth. The only type of prostration which causes the person to lose his faith is prostration for the sake of worship as for other types of prostration such as prostration for the sake of greeting and honoring is only prohibited and does not mount to disbelief (kufr). Examples for prostration for the sake of greeting and honoring occurred when the angels prostrated before Prophet Adam and when the brothers of Prophet Joseph prostrated before him and this type of prostration was amended and became impermissible in our Shari’ah. God says in this regard in the Quran, “And of His signs are the night and day and the sun and moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostate to Allah , who created them, if it should be Him that you worship.” 41:37Therefore prostration for the purpose of greeting and honoring is only prohibited but does not mount to disbelief and what actually makes a prohibited act as a sin is realizing that it is prohibited therefore the act is not considered a sin if the doer of such act is not aware of its prohibition and therefore does not result in losing his faith or driving him out of religion. The Prophetic evidence on that was reported by ibn Majah who related that when Mu’adh ibn Jabal came back from Yemen, he prostrated before the Prophet (peace be upon him). The Prophet in turn forbade Mu’adh from prostrating before him but did not describe his act as an act of disbelief or polytheism.Also it is well known that Mu’adh ibn Jabal- as the Prophet described him- is the Ummah’s most knowledgeable of matters which are prohibited and permitted. Therefore it is very obvious that Mu’adh understood that prostration is meant for worship which should not be directed to none save God but he also realized that there is a possibility that prostration could bear meanings other than worshipping the one before whom he prostrated. Therefore when a Muslim prostrates to anyone or thing other than God, it is impermissible to direct the purpose of this prostration to worshipping which leads to judging him or her with disbelief. Imam al Hafiz al Dhahabi al Shafi’i commented on this issue by saying, “Don’t you see that the prophet’s companions out of their utter love for Prophet Muhammad addressed him saying, “Shouldn’t we prostrate before you?” and he answered, “No”. This means that if the companion had the permission, they would have prostrated out of reverence and veneration and not for worship same as when the brothers of Prophet Joseph prostrated before him and same goes for Muslims who prostrate before the Prophet’s grave out of veneration and reverence, this act is not considered an act of disbelief but it is a sinful act. Therefore the doer of such act should know that it is prohibited” (book of Mu’gam al Shuyukh for Imam al Dhahabi, p. 56)The difference between the act of prostration when it is done by a Muslim and a non Muslim is that the Muslim believes that worshipping is only due to God the Almighty as for the polytheist, he believes in the permissibility of directing one’s worship to others save God. Therefore, if we see such act of prostration from a Muslim and this act bears many meanings such as worship and other meanings, we ought to direct the purpose of prostration to meanings which suit the theological belief of Muslims because whoever becoms a Muslim through solid faith and strong conviction should not be stripped of it out of probabilities and doubts.This ruling is based on a juristic legal maxim which clearly states that the actions which are done by Muslims should be interpreted in ways which do not contradict the original state of monotheism and it is impermissible to hastily accuse the Muslim with disbelief or polytheism. The fact of being a Muslim is such a strong evidence that necessitates for us not to interpret his actions as acts of disbelief. This capacious understanding was reiterated by Imam Malik who said in this regard, “Whoever carried out an action which could be interpreted from 99 ways as an act of disbelief and only could be interpreted from one way as an act of faith, we think of his act as an act of faith”.So rest assured dear sister that you have not lost your faith because of your prostration before your husband and you did not even commit a sin because you were unaware of what you were doing and you didn’t know at that time that prostration was prohibited. You are rather rewarded for your kind intention and for your sincere desire to please your husband and get close to his heart. We pray to God that you holdfast to your religion and guide you always to goodness and happiness in this world and the hereafter"

    "Answer": "Ibn ‘Abass said that It is not permissible for anyone to judge on behalf of God on His creation and it is not allowed for anyone to decide who enters heaven or hell. There is a difference between the general ruling that the polytheist and the disbeliever are staying eternally in hellfire and between applying this general ruling on a specific person per se because this specific person could be pardoned due to his lack of knowledge about Islam which was not presented to him in an attractive way that could hold him accountable before God. Although a person can be a disbeliever according to the apparent state of not embracing Islam, we are not certain if he is pardoned due to his lack of knowledge or not. Therefore it is permissible for you to pray for him and your prayer is not considered as a sin or disbelief because we simply don’t know his ultimate destiny. The mere fact of knowing that someone died as a non Muslim, does not necessarily make him enter hellfire eternally or make us believe that God will never forgive him. There is a difference between the general ruling for disbelievers who will stay eternally in hellfire and between each and every individual case as we don’t know if the message of Islam reached him/her clearly in a way which hold them accountable in God’s sight. The ultimate destiny of people is solely known and determined by God Almighty."

    "Answer": "The principle in the actions of a Muslim is that they must be interpreted in a manner that does not challenge his monotheism. It is impermissible to accuse him or her of disbelief and polytheism because his Islam is strong evidence to his belief. This is a general rule that all Muslims must follow when judging the actions of their Muslim brothers. Malik, the imam of Madina (may Allah have mercy on him), said: \"Whoever commits an act that carries 99 aspects of disbelief and one aspect of faith, he is still a believer\".The Kharijites are the only ones who deviate from this established ruling and work on deluding Muslims and taking them out of Islam.

    "Question": "eir Lord will not be concerned with other than Him?&rdquo;</p>",
    "Answer": "The meaning of the saying, “Whoever knows their Lord will not be concerned with other than Him,” is that whoever knows the Majesty, Might, and Perfection of God Most High will not find anything better than Him with which to concern themselves. As long as man is distracted and moves away from God, they will feel isolated and alone until they return to being concerned with the intimacy of their Lord, for that is true intimacy. This is accomplished through doing a lot of remembrance of Him. As the proverb says “He who tastes, knows, and he who knows, takes great draughts”. So the one who has tasted the sweetness of intimacy with God will not find pleasure with another, and whoever remembers Him constantly will attain intimacy with Him, so that even if they are outwardly concerned with other than Him, their hearts are always attached to God."

    "Answer": "Man is the creation of Allah. He, the Most High, has honored man for his humanity, molded him with His own hands, breathed into him from His Spirit and commanded His angels to prostrate to him. Allah expelled Satan from His mercy because he arrogantly refused to obey His Lord's command to prostrate to man.Respecting humanity is one of the angelic characteristics which form the foundation of Muslim civilization while dishonoring, humiliating and disdaining humans are satanic proclivities that shake the very foundation of civilizations. Allah says, So the roof fell upon them from above them, and the punishment came to them from where they did not perceive.[An-Nahl: 26] And whoever takes Satan as an ally instead of Allah has certainly sustained a clear loss.[An-Nisaa`: 119]Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange.[Al-Kahf: 50] Islam honors man for his humanity regardless of gender, race or color. It has likewise added another form of respect associated with the various functions Allah has given him and which agree with his God-given characteristics. This additional form of respect includes respecting one's parents whom Allah has made a cause for one's existence. Allah has associated showing gratitude to them with showing gratitude to Him. He the Almighty says, And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years. Be grateful to Me and to your parents; to Me is the [final] destination.[Luqman: 14] And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment.[Bani Isra`il: 23]This is because Allah has made parents the apparent cause for one's existence so the two of them are the greatest worldly manifestation for the characteristic of creation. If this is so, then what honor has Allah heaped upon them! A mother's statusThe Prophet established that mothers are the most worthy among the people of one's good companionship, giving them precedence over fathers. Abu Huraira [may Allah be pleased with him] narrated that a man approached the Prophetand said,\"O Messenger of Allah! Who among the people is the most worthy of my good companionship?”The Prophet replied, \"Your mother\".The man asked, “Then who?”The Prophet replied, \"Your mother.\"The man further asked, “Then who?”The Prophet replied, \"Your mother.\"The man asked again, “Then who?”The Prophet replied, \"Then your father.\" [Bukhari and Muslim] Maternity vs. paternityIslamic law affirms that the relationship between a child and its mother is a biological and organic relationship. His relationship with her is not dependent on whether she bore him within or outside of wedlock—indeed she is its mother in all circumstances. This is contrary to paternity which is only established through legal means.Celebrating Mother's Day and the stance of Islamic lawAmong the outward expressions of respecting one's mother is celebrating this day in her honor and being kind and dutiful towards her. There is nothing in Islamic law to prohibit an occasion in which children can celebrate their mothers. This is an organizational matter; there is nothing wrong with it and it bears no connection to the issue about which so many people murmur; the rejected innovations are those newly introduced matters that contravene Islamic law. The Prophet said, \"Whoever introduces into this affair of ours [the religion of Islam] that which is foreign to it, it will be rejected\" [Reported by Bukhari and Muslim from a hadith narrated by 'A`isha, (may Allah be pleased with her)]. The hadith means that any newly introduced matter that does not contravene Islamic law will be accepted.The Prophet approved when the Arabs celebrated national commemorations and tribal victories in which they would sing of their tribal feats and victories. 'A`isha (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet once entered upon her when she was accompanied by two bondmaids who were singing the songs sung at the battle of Bu'ath [Reported by Bukhari and Muslim].It is mentioned in the sunnah that the Prophet visited the grave of his mother, Amna, in Alfay Muqanna' and was never seen to cry more than on that day [recorded by Muslim and by Al-Hakim who declared it authentic].Lexical meaning of the word 'mother'The meaning of motherhood has assumed lofty denotations in the linguistic heritage of the Arabs. In the Arabic language, the word 'mother' refers to a source, habitat, a person in authority and the servant of a people who takes care of their food and serves them. This last meaning was related from Imam Al-Shafi`i (may Allah be pleased with him) who was among the experts of the Arabic language. Ibn Duraid said, \"In Arabic, anything to which other things around it are ascribed, is called 'mother'.\" Because of this, Mecca is dubbed the 'mother of cities' since it at the center of the world, the direction to which people turn to pray and is the most important city.Since language is the vessel of thought, for Muslims the immediate sense of the word 'mother' is associated with the person whom Allah has endowed with boundless generosity and who is the source of an individual's formation. She is the person who shelters him and takes care of his nurturing and upbringing and is endowed with love to care for him and look after his needs. In this sense, a mother is the source of affection and mercy for her children.Just as this meaning is clear in the original linguistic meaning of the word and the derivations from its root, our cultural heritage only clarifies and evidences this further with the compound word 'silat ar-raham' [literally: womb-ties]. This organic attribute symbolizes the continuity of family relations which forms the foundational elements for building human society. No one is more deserving of this ascription than the mother who is the reason life continues and families are formed and who is the manifestation of mercy. This matter reaches its fullness and perfection with the magnificent religious meanings portrayed by the Prophet who said, \"Family ties cling to the Throne, saying 'Allah will maintain ties with whoever maintains me and sever ties with whoever severs me\" [recorded by Bukhari and Muslim from a narration by 'A`isha (may Allah be pleased with her)]. In a hadith Qudsi, Allah Almighty says, \"I am God and I am the Compassionate. I created ties of kinship and derived a name for it from My own. So, whoever maintains it, I will maintain ties with him, and whoever severs it, I will sever ties with him\" {recorded by Abu Dawud and by at-Tirmidhi who declared it authentic}.Therefore celebrating mother's day is an expression of love and a token of gratitude which should be extended through out the year."

It is established in the Shari'ah that common social customs are permissible as log as they are compliant to the legal rulings. Claiming that this occasion originally contradicts the Shari'iah does not affect the matter, since it was forgotten by the passage of time. What really remain now are the forms of joy, going out and pleasing one family and the like as long as it does not contradict the Shari'ah. If these forms of celebration go beyond the limits of the Shari'ah and Islamic morals, it becomes then unlawful."

    "Question": "My sister is getting married and wants to pierce her belly button for adornment to please her husband. I was wondering what is the Islamic stance on this?",
    "Answer": "God created women and instilled in their nature the love of adornment and Islam came in total harmony with intrinsic nature of women and for this reason Islamic Shari’ah permitted for women to use all kinds of adornment. The juristic scholars reached a consensus on the permissibility of women taking all kinds of jewelries made of gold and silver such as necklaces, rings, bracelets, ankles, chains and all other adornments which women are used to wear and did not reach the level of extravagance or resemblance to what men wear.The jurists state that it is permissible for women to take gold jewelries as adornment according to their different cultures and customs. On the other hand, the Islamic law forbids any kinds of harm as one of the major legal maxims in jurisprudence is “don’t inflict harm on others and don’t harm yourself” and for this reason scholars differed on the jewelry which causes pain to the woman’s body such as piercing like earrings which necessitates to pierce the ear. The jurists believe that the Islamic legislation stressed on the importance that women attach to adornment and therefore permitted them to wear whatever they are used to according to their customary practices on the condition of not inflicting pain or harm on them.According to the above based opinion, as long as piercing the woman’s belly to wear jewelery is part of the customary practice in these countries therefore there is no legal impediment to women piercing their belly button with the condition of not inflicting any harm on her body as there are some recent scientific researches which points at some negative medical effects which result from piercing. Some of these bad effects result from not sterilizing the medical instruments. In other words if harm was proven or piercing was not carried out in the correct medical method then piercing automatically is deemed prohibited for inflicting harm on the body."

    "Answer": "AnswerThere is no harm in circulating photos of humans and animals since they only capture the rays of light and are free of imitating God’s creation about which makers of depictions were strongly warned. Hanging photos is permissible provided they are free of nudity and do not incite desire.Photos of women not wearing their hijab must be concealed from non-mahramsIf a woman is photographed without her complete Islamic attire, she must be careful not to let anyone except her mahrams (those to whom marriage is impermissible) view her photos. This is because a woman is to cover those parts of her body that must be concealed, preserve her chastity and observe modesty.The rulingIf after taking the necessary precautions, it happens that a non-mahram sees the photos, the woman is not blameworthy. It will not be considered an ongoing sin neither in her life nor after her death as it is claimed. The photos must not be put in a place where everyone may see them but must be concealed in the manner described above.God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "Should the words of tashmit (asking God to bestow his mercy on a person who sneezes) be said to a person once or after every time he sneezes?",
    "Answer": "Lexically, tashmit is supplicating God seeking His kindness and blessings. In Islamic law, it is supplicating God for one who has sneezed by seeking His mercy for him. It is a sunnah for a person who sneezes to praise God the Almighty after which a fellow Muslim is to pronounce the words of tashmit which is “Yarhamukum Allah.” The one who sneezed can reply by saying, \"Yahdikum Allah wa yusliha balakum (may God grant you guidance and peace of mind)\". This is based on the hadith recorded by Bukhari in his Sahih through Abu Huraira (may God be pleased with him) who narrated that the Prophet (God’s peace and blessings upon him) said, \"When any of you sneezes, he is to say, 'Al-hamdu-lil-Lah' (praise be to God) and his fellow brother or companion is to tell him, \"Yarhamuk Allah (may God have mercy on you). Then the person who has sneezed should reply and say, 'Yahdeekum Allah wa yusliha balakum.\"If someone sneezes more than twice or thrice, this might mean they are suffering from a cold and in which case, we must follow the Prophetic guidance and supplicate God for them with a suitable supplication by asking God for their recovery. A person must not pronounce tashmit to another who sneezes more than twice or thrice. The legal premise for this is the report recorded by Muslim and al-Tirmidhi through Salama ibn al-Akwa' (may God be pleased with him) who said, \"The Prophet said the words of tashmit to a man who sneezed twice by saying, 'May God bestow his mercy on you.' When the man sneezed a third time, the Prophet said, 'This man has a cold'\" (The report is in the words of al-Tirmidhi).God the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "I am an American Muslim girl who lives in the United States where I have a big non-Muslim family. Since I embraced Islam, I have had a hard time clarifying for my cousins that I cannot hug them. Please inform me about the legal rulings for hugging between men and women.",
    "Answer": "There is no legal impediment to hold you back from exchanging greetings through shaking hands as a sign of warm greetings and heartfelt welcome as long as there is no risk of intimacy or fear of rising lusts. It was reported through al-Bukhari that Anas ibn Malik narrated that, “girls from al Medinah would take the Prophet’s hand and wander with him where they want”. As for shaking hands with women, Imam Ahmad reported that it is a disliked act. The majority of scholars except for the Shafi’is do not permit shaking hands between male and female youth. The Shafi’is permitted shaking hands between the youth of the two sexes with two conditions: no risk of intimacy and existence of a barrier.Therefore, if reasons for mixing between males and females exist along with safety from any potential lusts then it is permissible to shake hands when necessary such as greetings after travelling or greetings during visits etc…God has forbidden us from committing sins and entertaining immoralities or even approaching them, God says, “…And do not approach immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed...” (Quran 6:151). Part of approaching immoralities and sins is committing what would lead to them; there is no doubt that hugging between males and females (who are eligible legally in Islamic law to marry each other) can very well be considered as an introduction to sin that may follow suit.Therefore hugging and kissing between males and females whether relatives or not (as long as they are legally eligible to marry each other) is absolutely prohibited as hugging and kissing raises possibilities of intimacy and runs the risk of lusts. What you need to do is to kindly inform your male relatives that you will not be able to hug and kiss them for religious reasons with the hope that they respect your personal choice and religious beliefs."

They also utter words of polytheism and disbelief. How can I deal with them on daily basis for the sake of guiding them to the true path?",
    "Answer": "You have to be easy and lenient with your parents as Islam does not appreciate isolation of the Muslim from his social surrounding. Also you have to be very careful not to call yourself “more religious” than your parents because you simply don’t know who is more virtuous in God’s sight. Your parents might be more beloved and virtuous in God’s sight with their sincere hearts regardless of their acts and sayings which you think mount to sins. The mere fact that your parents watch movies or listen to music and the like is not a sin as what mounts to a sin is watching things which cause God’s discontent and same goes for listening to music as listening in itself is not prohibited as songs are simply words which can be either good or bad and we ought to avoid bad ones. As for the words that your parents utter and you classify them as words of polytheism or disbelief can simply be a sheer misunderstanding in your mind to what mounts to disbelief. Therefore you have to be careful not to judge your parents and think of their acts as prohibited in Islamic law.You also have to stop thinking that you are better than your parents or closer to God than them because what actually matters is sincerity of the heart even if the acts were not many. Thus you have to be merciful with your parents as the mercy of the Muslim should flow over to encompass all people around him or her. You also have to bear in mind that Islam commanded us to be gentle and kind with our parents even if they were disbelievers let alone if they were Muslims.I advise you dear sister to reconsider your position towards your parents and the judging attitude over their acts and sayings. Also you should not listen to the talks of half scholars and self claimed scholars who lack both religious knowledge and intellectual discernment to pass juristic rulings and lack the ability to comprehend the meanings of the textual doctrine."

    "Question": "Are non Muslims our enemy? I wonder why I have friends who have never talked about religion since we met and I know them over years without any enmity to me as a Muslim.",
    "Answer": "Coexistence in IslamThe principle underlying the relationship between Muslims and non- Muslims is coexistence. Allah commands Muslims to treat other people kindly provided they do not manifestly declare malice towards them and to think well of all of people alike. A person who thoroughly explores the verses of the noble Qur`an will find that, in its entirety, it presents an integrated Qur`anic methodology concerning the treatment of non-Muslims. It is noteworthy to mention that the variation in the manner of treating non-Muslims does not stem from a methodological inconsistency; rather, it depends on the different attitudes of the people we deal with. People are different [with respect to behavior] and thus they must not be judged alike. It is considered a methodical injustice to generalize what has been made specific or to specify what has been left general in legal texts.Just as there are individuals who accept Muslims' beliefs, there are others who differ with them. Among this latter group, there are some who merely present their opinions or beliefs and those who go as far as to attack those who differ with them. Therefore, both groups are treated differently. Evidence from Qur`anThere are many verses in the Qur`an, whether those revealed in Mecca or Medina, that urge Muslims to be tolerant towards others and to treat them kindly. These include:So pardon and overlook until Allah delivers His command. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent. (Al-Baqarah: 109)There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. (Al-Baqarah: 256)Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly. (Al-Mumtahana, 8)The above verses from Surah al-Baqarah and al-Mumtahana were revealed in Medina and all of them exhort Muslims to be kind and merciful to their fellow men. As for the legal texts [Qur`an and Sunnah] that command Muslims to be harsh towards some people, they can be compared to the previous verses as two integrated methodologies that deal with two different types of people:The first methodology, which is the general case, enjoins Muslims to treat all people with kindness through dialogue and respect of freedom [of faith]. This is the correct basis for inviting others to Islam; this does not abrogate a Qur`anic verse nor has it been abrogated though some jurists claim the contrary. Allah Almighty says,And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zakah. (Al-Baqarah: 83)In another verse, Allah instructs those who call others to His way on how they should invite others according to the different types of people:Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided. (An-Nahl: 12)Allah says about the People of the Book,And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, \"We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him. (Al-'Ankabut: 46)The second methodology is concerned with those who attack Muslims, in which case it is necessary to defend oneself. Allah Almighty says,(Fighting in) the sacred month is for [aggression committed in] the sacred month, and for [all] violations is legal retribution. So whoever has assaulted you, then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you. And fear Allah and know that Allah is with those who fear Him. (Al-Baqarah: 194)Unlike the policy followed by some countries, Muslims do not treat others based on whether they are with or against them. Rather, Islam teaches its followers that people are different and must therefore be treated accordingly with respect to time and type of person."

    "Answer": "This belief contradicts the fundamentals of the Islamic doctrine. You need to advise this young man to seek sound teachings of Islam from authentic prominent Muslim scholars. You must not accept his marriage proposal until he adheres to the methodology of the Sunnis with respect to such fundamentals of the faith.The prophetic traditions (the Sunnah) are the second legal source for Islamic legislation and serves as supplementary to the Quranic text which forms the first legal source of Shari’ah. Scholars opined that the prophetic traditions play different roles as it can be explanatory to the Quranic text and it also can be independent source for legislation.Definition: The sunnah is defined as “statements, actions, tacit approvals, or qualities related about the Prophet (upon him be peace).”In terms of statements, we may take the example of that which is related from Umar b. Al-Khattab, who said: “I heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) saying, ‘Actions are only by intentions. So, every man will have that which he intended.”In the category of actions are included all actions of the Prophet that have reached us, such as his manner of doing ablutions (wudu’), and of performing the pilgrimage (hajj). And so, we have a hadith from the Prophet, saying “Pray as you have seen me pray.” Similarly in his final pilgrimage, he said, “Take the hajj rituals from me.”Tacit approvals consist of the Prophet’s affirmations of the statements or actions of the Companions, either through his silence (and, therefore, lack of repudiation), or through his express agreement and commendation. Examples of this include the narration of Abu Sa’id al-Khudri who said, “Two men set out on travel. When the time for prayer came, neither of them had any water with him. So they performed tayammum and prayed. Thereafter, they came across water while the time of prayer had not expired. One of them performed his regular ablutions and repeated his prayer, while the other did not.Then, they came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and mentioned to him what had transpired. He said to the one who did not repeat the prayer, ‘You have achieved the sunna, and your prayer was valid.’ And to the one who performed the ablutions and prayed again, he said, ‘You have two rewards.’”As for qualities, many of the Prophet’s qualities and characteristic have been related. Some scholars have even taken to compiling these, such as al-Tirmidhi in his work, al-Shama’il.The types of rulings found in the sunna:1. Rulings according with and emphasizing the rulings of the Quran. An example of this is a hadith related by Anas b. Malik who said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “The wealth of a Muslim is not permissible to another except with his agreement and permission.” This is in agreement with the verse, “O ye who believe! Squander not your wealth among yourselves in vanity, except it be a trade by mutual consent,” (al-Nisa: 29).2. Rulings that clarify and explain general commandments in the Qur’an. An example of this is that which clarifies the amounts for zakat.3. Rulings that restrict or specify general commands of the Qur’an. An example is the general Qur’anic command to amputate the hand of the thief, which the sunna specified is to be done at the wrist. Another example is the general Qur’anic prohibition against eating carrion: “Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah.” (al-Ma’ida: 3). However, the following hadith from Ibn ‘Umar exempts seafood from this prohibition. According to Ibn ‘Umar, the Prophet said, “Two types of blood and two types of dead meat have been made permissible for us: of the dead meat, fish and locusts; and of the blood, liver and spleen.”4. New rulings not mentioned in the Qur’an, because the sunna is an independent source of legislation. In this regard, it is not unlike the Qur’an. It is reliably transmitted that the Prophet said, “I have been given the Book and something like it with it. I have been given the Qur’an and something like it with it.... So mandatory upon you is the Qur’an. What you find deemed permissible in it has been made permissible for you, and what what you find deemed impermissible in it has been made impermissible for you. So, neither the domesticated donkey nor any predator with fangs is permissible for you.” This means the Prophet was given the Qur’an and something like it, i.e. the sunna. The rulings of both must be followed, and from this we come to know of the prohibition against eating both domesticated donkeys and fanged predators, as well as the prohibition against eating birds with claws, and the rulings on the inheritance of the grandmother, etc.Therefore, denying the Prophet’s sunnah tantamount to denying a fundamental base of Islamic legislation."

    "Question": "wants to be a Muslim. I need your help in that please.</p>",
    "Answer": "There are three key issues about the Islamic faith which should be well addressed and emphatically tackled with those who desire to embrace Islam and equally to Muslims and non Muslims as well.The first key issue which softens people’s hearts towards Islam is the all encompassing mercy which envelops the Islamic message. God says in the Quran about the Prophet “(O Muhammad) Indeed we have not sent you except as a mercy to the worlds” (21:107). Also the Prophetic hadith of mercy is known among traditionists as the hadith of precedence because it is the first hadith which the Sheikh teaches his students because of its overarching nature and for being the key point to understanding the spirit of the Islamic shari’ah. The hadith was reported by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al- ‘As that the Prophet said “the merciful ones are bestowed with mercy from God; have mercy on those on earth and the One in the sky will have mercy on you”.There are two versions of this hadith, the first makes God’s mercy conditional on having mercy on those on earth, whereas the second version makes God’s mercy as a sort of supplication or plead for mercy to descend upon those who have mercy on those on earth.This haidth is essential in dealing with others as the Arabic proposition of “on” in the term on earth is very powerful as it includes both animate and inanimate objects. Imam al Razi and Imam al Burhan al Bajouri among many other imams stated that we should pay attention to two concepts the first is the community of calling (ummat al da’wah) and the community of acceptance (ummat al Ijabah). The first community which we call to Islam are about 7 billion people on the face of the earth so this community includes all people. As for the second community, it encompasses those who responded to the message of Islam and embraced it.Therefore we are between brothers in humanity and brothers in religion and it is incumbent upon you to have mercy on those who are on earth. Islam expanded the range of mercy to make it as the broad headline for being a human and for this reason God started the Quran with “in the name of God most Merciful most Gracious” and did not say “in the name of God most Merciful Most vengeful” for example or “In the name of God the vengeful the slayer”. So God incorporated beauty and mercy as titles with which He would be known. God expanded the range of mercy to include animals as well and for this reason the Prophet said “a woman entered hell fire because of a cat which she imprisoned, she neither fed the cat nor let it out to eat from land” and also said “a prostitute woman from the Israelites entered paradise because she offered water for a thirsty dog so God forgave her and granted her paradise”. (al Bukhari).God further extended his mercy to encompass inanimate objects as well and not only humans and animals. For this reason God informed us that this whole universe which surrounds us is praising and glorifying God. God said in the Quran “The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving” (17:44)God made this animate object eligible to praise and thus we should deal with them with mercy. The Prophet said to lady ‘Aisha “O ‘Aisha mercy does not encompass anything except it beautifies it and is not extracted from anything except it mars it.”If we adopted the path of mercy, if we understood that God started his holy Quran with it, that God obliged Himself with it along with understanding the interrelated circles of mercy which encompass the whole universe, we would be able to deal with other people in a way which leads to improving the image of Islam in their eyes and made them experience the beauty and the mercy of Islam first hand. The other party will automatically feel the soft hearts of Muslims and that they have an open heart with which they love all people.The second essential key point in Islam which should be emphatically addressed is the issue of refined manners and high ethical standards. This issue is a sacramental matter which stems from the root of mercy. God greatly praised Prophet Muhammad in the Quran when He said “and verily (O Muhammad) you are on an exalted standard of ethical manners” (68:4) Therefore, Muslims are expected to follow suit and refine their manners to trace the Prophetic footsteps in the path of perfecting their ethics.The third key point in Islam has to do with the Islamic doctrine of oneness (al tawhid). This issue is deemed central in the Islamic creed as Muslims surrender their hearts and submit their bodies for the one and only lord of heavens and earth. God has sent messengers for humanity to guide their way back to Him and Prophet Muhammad in this regard is the seal of a long chain of messengers along the history. Messengers are sent with holy books revealed by God to guide humanity in their path towards their divine origin. Quran in this regard is the last testament which is well preserved and was not subjected to any abridgements or distortions.With these three essential key points: mercy, ethical manners, and the Islamic creed of oneness of God, Quran being the last testament and that Prophet Muhammad was the final connection between heaven and earth, the one who desires to embrace Islam would have a solid base on which he would be able to accept the Islamic teachings which corresponds in nature to these three essential key points.Once these issues are well understood, the practical aspects of practicing the faith which correspond to the doctrinal framework established above could be gradually taught. The first of these practical aspects is prayer as it is an integral part of the Islamic faith and indicates a divine relationship between the Creator and the created where the worshipper gets to have a personal conversation with his Lord five times a day with no barriers or prior appointments.The other pillars of Islam such as fasting the month of Ramadan and pilgrimage to Makkah at least once in the life time for those who are physically and financially able along with paying zakah should the money reach certain amount, are issues which can be taught gradually along with the issue of trying to read Quran and learn Arabic. This process could take sometime and Muslims should not be hasten to teach the new converts all the Islamic teachings as one bulk as this would be too much for anyone to take in. The process should be gradual but steady enveloped with mercy and love."

    "Question": "st from Pakistan which has arrived via e-mail and includes the following:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">We have witnessed and heard media reports on the bombings which have occurred lately in Pakistan on 25 December 2010 against a World Food Programme distribution center frequented by the poor and homeless. The attack, which targeted unarmed civilians, left more than 40 dead and at least 70 others wounded. What is the legal ruling for such attacks?</p>",
    "Answer": "There is no doubt that these recent bombings are legally prohibited for the following reasons:1. Violation of primary texts (the Qur`an and sunnah)There are several dimensions to these violations. They include:- Killing Muslims whose lives are sacrosanct. Islamic law places great value on the lives of Muslims and gravely warns against murdering or encroaching upon them without right. Allah the Almighty says,If a man kills a Believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, to abide therein (for ever): and the wrath and the curse of Allah are upon him, and a dreadful chastisement is prepared for him. [An-Nisaa`, 93]On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if anyone slew a person—unless it be for murder or spreading mischief in the land—it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. [Al-Ma`ida, 32]Al-Nisa`i reported in his Sunnan through 'Abdullah Ibn 'Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet said, \"The passing away of this world would mean less to Allah than the murder of a Muslim.\" Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with both) said, \"I saw the Messenger of Allah circumambulate the Ka'bah and say, 'How great you are and how sweet is your smell! How great you are and how great is your sanctity! By Him in Whose Hands is the soul of Mohammed, the inviolability of a believer—his property and blood—is greater to Allah than yours! We are to only think well of a believer\" [Ibn Majah].- Killing people and taking them by surprise. Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, \"A believer is not to be killed [by deception]. Faith is a deterrent to such a killing\" [Recorded by Abu Dawud and by Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak]. Ibn Athir wrote in Al-Nihaya, \"Killing by deception is to take others unawares and kill them.\" The hadith means that faith prevents a person from attacking others unawares, much in the same way as a hobble hampers freedom of movement. The Prophet's words 'A believer is not to attack [others] by surprise' is either a propositional statement and therefore a prohibition since it denotes deception, or an explicit prohibition.2. Violating the objectives of Islamic lawIslamic law stresses the obligation to uphold the five things which are recognized by all faiths, namely the preservation of religion, life, intellect, honor and wealth. These are called the five exigencies of Islamic law. There is no doubt that the bombings in question violate some of these objectives which must be preserved. These include:The preservation of lifeIf the person killed and the suicide bomber are one and the same i.e. it is the same person who carries out the operation and blows himself up by tying explosives around his body or the like with the intention of killing others without right and in enmity, then he is included under the general implication of the words of the Prophet who said, \" Whoever kills himself with anything in this world, he will be tortured with it on the day of Judgment\" [Recorded by Abu 'Awana in his Mustadrak through Thabit Ibn al-Dahhak (may Allah be pleased with him)]. Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said, \"Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron, he will hold it in his hands and stab himself with it in Hell-fire which will be his eternal abode; whoever kills himself with poison, he will drink from it in Hell-fire which will be his eternal abode; whoever kills himself by jumping off a mountain, he will keep jumping off a mountain in Hell-fire which will be his eternal abode\" [Recorded by Muslim in his Sahih]. Imam Nawawi dedicated a chapter to the above hadith in his commentary on the Sahih of Muslim and which he entitled \"The enormity of taking one's life and being punished by the instrument of his death.\"If the person killed is other than the bomber, then the gravity of the sin of deliberately killing another Muslim is second only to disbelief. There was a debate among the Companions and those who followed them as to whether Allah accepts the repentance of such a person. If the person killed is a non-Muslim living in a Muslim land, he is under the protection of the state concerned but if he is attacked in his own land, he is considered an unsuspecting innocent victim. Under all circumstance, civilian lives are to be protected and it is prohibited to encroach upon them.Preservation of wealthBombings infringe upon the preservation of property. There is no doubt that the ramifications of such bombings include loss of wealth and destruction of public and private properties and buildings, both of which are prohibited by Islamic law. The prohibition is even greater if the property is not owned by the perpetrator but by others as is the case in this scenario. The prohibition concerns contravening Islamic law on the one hand and violating the rights of others on the other.3- Consequent damageIslamic law revolves around promoting and implementing interests and warding off and suspending harm. No one of sound mind can doubt the evil ramifications incurred upon Muslims living in different parts of the world due to these destructive acts. Such actions are used as a pretext [by other countries] to interfere in the internal affairs of Muslim countries, gain control over them, and exploit their wealth and plunder their resources—all under the name of combating terrorism, preserving economic interests or freeing nations. Whoever assists these countries to achieve their objectives by perpetrating such foolish acts creates a breach, assisting them in abasing Muslims and gaining control over Muslim lands—all among the gravest of crimes. Scholars have established the principle that when interest conflicts with evil, warding off evil takes precedence over gaining interests. This concerns irrefutable interest. Imagine then when the interest is either false or non-existent?Scholars have called the act of terrorizing people, murdering them and destroying property and wealth within a Muslim society, as is the case with bomb attacks in Muslim lands, haraba. It is corruption in the land and its perpetrator deserves a harsher penalty than that of a murderer, a thief or a fornicator. This is because his act is a criminal methodology against society. Allah the Almighty says,The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter. [Al-Ma`ida, 33]Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "We have a graveyard that is full [the bodies have disintegrated to bones] and we do not have any other place to bury our dead. What are we to do with new bodies?</p>",
    "Answer": "When a grave becomes full, it is necessary to bury new bodies in new plots since it is impermissible to bury more than one individual in a single grave except when necessary. Permissibility of burying more than one individual in a single grave In the presence of a necessity such as limited burial plots, it is permissible to bury more than one individual in a single grave as was the case with the martyrs of the battle of Uhud. Manner of burying more than one individual in a single grave A barrier is to be made between individuals buried in the same grave even if they are of the same gender. When there is limited burial space, as mentioned in the question, you may construct multiple levels inside the same grave if possible. Alternatively, you can construct an arch made of bricks or stones over the body previously buried without having them touch the bodies. Then you are to heap earth over the arch and bury a new corpse over it. Allah Almighty knows best."

    "Answer": "It is permissible to give foreign refugees—Muslims or non-Muslims—monetary alms, the meat of sacrificial animals or even the whole animal, its hide, head or any of its parts—meat or otherwise. It is permissible to establish an endowment fund and spend its proceeds on their education, housing, medical treatment and transportation both within and outside the country. It is also permissible to give them from zakat money, though only to the Muslims from among them because zakat is given exclusively to Muslims. The fact that the above acts are merely permissible does not mean that a person is to procrastinate when performing this social duty. Rather, those who have the means must contribute to this cause—each according to his capacity, and desire to do good and earn the reward of Allah the Almighty. May Allah the Almighty accept their good deeds!"

    "Question": " no. 2908 for the year 2005 which includes the following:<br />\r\nMany youths belong to a group that claims to be the only one that follows the example of the salaf (pious predecessors) and the straight path. Its members accuse all those who disagree with them of treason, disbelief, and atheism &mdash; they do not even spare the scholars. They attack the ideology of the Azhar and its scholars, and accuse the Ash'aris of innovation. What is your opinion on this group regarding keeping the beard, shortening garments, and their claims that qunut supplications in morning prayers are an innovation?<br />\r\n<font size=\"6\" class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 22px\"><br />\r\n</span></font></p>",
    "Answer": "Muslim youths, especially those who seek knowledge, must work towards uniting Muslims and not strive to create dissonance and dissension. Allah the Almighty commands us to hold fast to His firm rope and not split into factions over religious matters. He said, Hold fast to God's rope all together; do not split into factions. [Al-'Imran, 103]And obey Allah and His Messenger; And fall not into disputes, Lest ye lose heart and your power depart; And be patient and persevering: For Allah is with those who patiently persevere. [Al-Anfal, 46]Allah also commands us to speak good words to others. He said,And remember We took a covenant from the children of Israel (to this effect): Worship none but Allah; Treat with kindness your parents and kindred, and orphans and those in need; Speak fair to the people; Be steadfast in prayer; and give zakat, then did you turn back, except a few among you, and ye backslide (even now). [Al-Baqarah, 83]The Messenger of Allah ordered us to embrace everything that leads to unity to the extent that a person is even rewarded for smiling at another. Youths must distance themselves from the methodology of accusing others of disbelief and the trends of accusing others of innovation, dissolution and misguidance — common accusations made by pseudo-scholars at present. Moreover, youths must conform to proper etiquette with eminent scholars and the pious of the community. Any group that adopts the title of 'salaf' to screen its designs and create dissension and discord among Muslims has mixed truth with falsehood. Allah the Almighty says,And cover not truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth when ye know (what it is). [Al-Baqarah, 42]The AzharIt is known that the venerable Azhar institution follows the Ash'ari ideology which is that of the sunnis. The Ash'aris (may Allah be pleased with them and gratify them) comprise the majority of the community scholars; they are those who have repelled the doubts cast by atheists and others and are those who, over the course of history, have adhered to the Book of Allah and the sunnah of our Messenger . Whoever accuses them of disbelief or impiety, risks forfeiting his faith. The hadith scholar, Ibn 'Asaker (may Allah have mercy on him) mentions in his book Tabyeen Kidhb al-Muftari Imam Abu Hasan al- Ash'ari's words [on the danger of reviling scholars]. He said, \"Know, may Allah grant us His satisfaction and make us among those who are mindful of Him as much as He is worthy, that the flesh of scholars is poisonous. It is well known that Allah exposes those who seek to vilify them; whoever insults them, Allah will cause his heart to decay before he actually dies.\"Throughout Islamic history, the venerable Azhar has been the minaret of knowledge and religion — it remains the greatest religious institution the community has ever known after the first three centuries of Islam. Through the Azhar, Allah has guarded His religion against the critics and skeptics. Whoever attacks its noble religious mission stands in great danger of becoming one of the dissenters and those who spread falsehoods to cause sedition of whom Allah says,Truly, if the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who stir up sedition in the city, desist not, We shall certainly stir thee up against them: Then will they not be able to stay in it as thy neighbors for any length of time. [Al-Ahzab, 60]Shaving the beardIt is established in Islamic law that keeping the beard and refraining from shaving it are from the acts of the Prophet ; he used to trim his beard and its top portions to match the contour of his face and his overall appearance. He also used to wash his beard with water and comb it. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) followed him in his actions and decisions. There are Prophetic traditions that support keeping and grooming the beard just as there are traditions that support the use of the siwak [toothstick], paring the nails and trimming the moustache. Some scholars have taken these hadiths to mean that these actions are obligatory, and according to this opinion, shaving the beard would be prohibited. Other scholars have taken these hadiths to mean that these actions are recommended, and according to this opinion keeping the beard is a sunnah — one is rewarded for keeping it and not punished for leaving it. The text proofs used to substantiate the former opinion are the hadiths encouraging Muslims to grow their beard to distinguish themselves from Zoroastrians and polytheists. It has also been narrated through 'A`isha (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet said, \"Ten things are from the primordial state: trimming the moustache, keeping the beard, using the siwak, snuffing water and expelling it from the nose to clean it, paring nails, cleaning knuckles, plucking out underarm hair, shaving pubic hair, and decreasing the amount of water one uses\" [Imam Muslim]. Some of the narrators reported [that the Prophet said], \"... and I forgot the tenth, which is rinsing the mouth with water.\"Shafi'i scholars who are the proponents of the second opinion based their opinion on the understanding that commands related to customs, food, drink, clothing, sitting, outward appearance, and so forth, are recommended and not obligatory. To substantiate this, they cited the examples of the command to dye clothes and pray in one's sandals and the like, to prove that these are not commands meaning obligatory actions, but rather recommended actions as Ibn Hajr al-'Asqalani mentions in his Fat-h Al-Bari.Based on the above, there is a scholarly debate concerning the ruling for shaving the beard. When there is a variance of legal opinions concerning an issue, it is preferable to avoid it. If this is not possible, one should follow the scholars who permit it.Shortening clothesThe basic principle regarding clothing, is permissibility provided this does not involve extravagance or arrogance. This is based on the hadith narrated by 'Abdullah Ibn 'Amr (may Allah be pleased with them both) who reported that the Prophet said, \"Eat, drink, give charity, and dress, but without extravagance or arrogance\" [recorded by Ahmad, al-Nasa`i and Ibn Majah; Al-Hakem declared it authentic]. It is this meaning that is deduced from the hadiths prohibiting dragging the hem of garments. These include:• The Prophet said, \"That part of the garment hanging below the ankles is in hell\" [Bukhari].• The Prophet said, \"There are three [kinds of] people whom Allah will not talk to, look at, or purify on the Day of Judgment and who will endure a painful torment.\" The Prophet repeated this thrice. Abu Dharr (may Allah have mercy on him) said, \"They have failed and are ruined. O Messenger of Allah! Who are they?\" The Prophet replied, \"Those who wear the hems of their garment below their ankles, those who remind others of their charity to them, and those who sell their merchandise swearing that they paid for it more than they actually did\" [Muslim]. This hadith is interpreted to designate those who do any of the above out of arrogance and pride as is explicit from other hadiths such as the following:• 'Abdullah Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) narrated that the Prophet said, \"On the Day of Judgment, Allah will not look at whoever lets the hem of his garment drag on the ground out of arrogance\" [recorded in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim].Imam al-Nawawi said that the general meaning of these hadiths must be restricted to dragging the hem of garments on the ground out of vanity. Imam al-Shafi'i mentioned the need to differentiate between dragging the hem of garments on the ground out of arrogance and for other reasons. Imam al-Bukhari devoted a chapter in his Sahih to this issue and called it 'Those who drag the hem of their garments on the ground for reasons other than pride', and included [the following] hadiths in it: • Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) narrated that Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"O Messenger of Allah! One side of my robe gets lose and slips to the ground unless I constantly tend to it .\" The Prophet replied, \"You are not of those who do this out of pride.\"• Abu Bakra (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"The solar eclipse occurred while we were sitting with the Prophet . He got up and rushed to the mosque, dragging his robe behind him. The people assembled and the Prophet led [them] in a two rak'ah prayer. When the eclipse cleared, the Prophet turned towards us and said, 'The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. So, if you see them eclipse, pray and supplicate to Allah until He clears them.'These two hadiths explicitly demonstrate that dragging the hem of garments on the ground is prohibited only when done out of pride and arrogance. This is because rulings are contingent upon the existence or absence of their causes.In the venerable Islamic law, customs play a role in matters of dress and outward appearances. The Prophet prohibited dressing for recognition in a manner that contravenes the customs of one's people. 'Abdullah Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) reported that the Prophet said, \"Whoever dresses for recognition, Allah will clothe him with the robe of ignominy on the Day of Resurrection\" [recorded by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah. The hadith scholar, al-Mundhiri declared it fair]. When the Companions entered Persia, they prayed in Persian pants. Scholars have mentioned that there is no harm if, by convention, people lengthen their garments so that each group is distinguished by its garbs and their customs allow it — only long clothes worn out of arrogance are prohibited. A Muslim, who desires [to follow] the sunnah, must be acquainted with the realities of his times; he must apply the sunnah prudently in such a way as to encourage people to adhere to it and not turn them away from their religion. Moreover, he must differentiate between the actions of the Prophet as a man and others dictated by custom and other traditions. He must be careful not to prioritize recommended actions over obligatory ones nor be diligent with external matters at the expense of internal ones. He must be gentle towards others and guide them in a manner they can understand, while simultaneously accommodating their customs lest he be instrumental in discrediting and depreciating the sunnah. Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"Talk to the people about what they know and refrain from what is strange to them; would you that Allah and His Messenger be accused of lying?\"[Bukhari and others]. 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"You will cause some people tribulation if you speak to them beyond their comprehension\" [Muslim].QunutMaking qunut during dawn prayers is a confirmed Prophetic tradition. The pious predecessors from among the Prophet's Companions, their successors and later scholars maintained its validity. Anas Ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"The Prophet made qunut for a whole month asking Allah to punish [the tribes of Ra'l and Dhakhwan] and then ceased to make it. He continued to observe qunut during dawn prayers until his death\" [This hadith was recorded by a group of hadith scholars who declared it authentic]. Shafi'i and Maliki scholars followed the hadith in the well known opinion of their schools. According to them, it is recommended to make qunut under any circumstances during dawn prayers. They held that what has been reported on the abrogation of qunut or its prohibition applies to observing it against a specific group of people and not qunut in general. Another group of scholars which include the Hanafis and Hanbalis maintained that qunut during dawn prayer is conditioned with the presence of afflictions and trials befalling Muslims. Consequently, qunut is not allowed in their absence. This is the opinion of Hanafi and Hanbali scholars. There is no contention on the permissibility of making qunut during the dawn prayer if an affliction befalls Muslims; the contention only concerns making qunut during the other prescribed prayers. Some scholars such as the Malikis restricted making qunut to the dawn prayer. Others, such as the Hanafis, maintained its permissibility during all of the audible prayers. In the most correct opinion of their school, Shafi'i scholars maintained that qunut is permissible in all of the prescribed prayers at times of affliction and trials. They cited examples of afflictions such as epidemics, draught, torrential rains, fear of enemies and the capture of scholars. In brief, scholars have debated the permissibility of making qunut during dawn prayers at times other than afflictions and trials. At such times, they agreed not only on its permissibility but its recommendation in dawn prayers, though they differed on its observance during the other prescribed prayers. Based on this, the objection to making qunut during dawn prayers on the pretext that it is an innovation is invalid. There is no doubt that the Muslim community is beset with catastrophes, epidemics and attacks launched by other nations against it. All of these require supplicating Allah in abundance to release us from the grip of others, return our lands and please His Prophet with the victory of his community and return of its sanctuaries, for Allah is Ever-Near, the Responsive. This applies if we take into account the continuity of afflictions and their unrestrictedness. Those who limit the period of the observance of qunut to not more than one month or forty days, base their opinion on adhering to the opinion of the followed scholars who employed ijtihad and whom we have been commanded to follow. Allah the Almighty says,Ask the people of knowledge if you do not know. [An-Nahl, 43]Whoever follows another scholar whose opinion on this issue he deems right is not entitled to disagree with others who observe qunut. This is because the legal axiom states, \"Objection is not for issues where there is a difference of opinion\" and \"One legal opinion does not nullify another\".Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Answer": "Scope of the Shari'ah A mildly mentally retarded person of the type mentioned above is entitled to marry provided the pillars of marriage are met. If the Shari‘ah permits marriage of the insane, then it is more reasonable to permit the marriage of a person who is only mildly mentally retarded; there is no harm in this as long he has someone to look after his interests and attend to his care. Books on jurisprudence of all legal schools devoted a lot of attention to the marriage of the insane and the guardianship of those who have the authority to compel them to marry. They disagree on whether this authority is restricted to the father and grandfather, extends to others who can act as guardians or even to the ruler (the judge) – all of which are for the benefit of this person in whom sexual needs and emotions are inherent qualities and who needs a home, financial support, and care. A mentally retarded person is like all others of the members of his gender, though he has certain extra needs that stem from his special circumstances. From Hanafi jurisprudence in Kashshaf al-Qina’, we read: \"As for an insane woman: all of those who can act as her guardians have the authority to marry her to someone if she shows signs of desiring men. This is because she has a need to marry to avert the harm of her sexual needs, to protect her from lewdness, obtain her bridal gift and marital expenses, secure her chastity, and preserve her honor. Because of all of the above, she is allowed to marry […]. Her desire in men is known from what she says, the attention she gives them, and from similar indicative behavior. Similarly, if one trustworthy medical expert – when two cannot be found then one – determines that her illness will be cured by marriage, then her guardian has the authority to give her away in marriage because, like treatment, this is in her best interest. If an insane woman who has sexual needs does not have a guardian, then the judge undertakes the responsibility of her marriage.\" While there is a difference between someone who is insane and someone who is mentally retarded, they still share common ground that is significant to the issue of marriage: a person who is capable of having sexual intercourse is naturally disposed to having a social life and needs care, support, and financial provisions. It is obvious that the control exercised by the guardian must be solely in the best interest of his charge; the matter must not turn into human trafficking by using these mentally retarded persons for inhumane and immoral purposes. Based on this, there is nothing to prevent a mentally retarded person from marrying because marriage is one thing and reproduction is another. Marriage involves companionship, kindness, love, co-operation, support, affiliation, and other lofty goals in addition to reproduction. If reproduction were necessarily inseparable from marriage, then the marriage of the elderly who cannot reproduce, infertile couples, or the young would be invalid. Marriage does not necessarily entail reproduction; reproduction can be controlled in one way or another and medical experts can determine the means to prevent, delay, or limit reproduction that are suitable for the interests of each individual case. The principle is that guardians and parents must act in the best interests of mentally retarded individuals. It is not permissible to prevent them from marrying if this is in their best interest in regard to their health, psychological state and financial situation. Rather, it is possible to unite people with similar or quasi similar problems in marriage through the institutions and organizations that cater to the needs of the mentally retarded. A delay on the guardian’s part to meet the best interests his mentally retarded charge – in the existence of their preliminaries – constitutes negligence and a sin proportionate to his failure to actualize the good that his charge is most likely to benefit from. Allah the Almighty knows best."

    "Question": "We have received request no. 2341 for the year 2004, which includes the following:",
    "Answer": "What is niqab? Niqab is a veil that covers the entire face except for the eyes.The hijab, the legal attire required of a Muslim woman consists of:• Any garment which does not cling to the body, • that is not transparent, • and that conceals the entire body except the face and hands.There is no harm in wearing colored clothes provided they are not vibrant, eye catching, or incite desire.Opinion of scholars and the Muslim community • The majority of scholars maintain that it is not obligatory for a woman to cover her face or wear gloves. The permissibility of exposing her face and hands is based on the Quranic verse: \"And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof\" (Quran 24:31).• The majority of scholars from among the companions and those who came after them interpreted 'adornments' in the above verse to mean the face and hands. They based their opinion on reports from ibn Abbas, Anas, and 'Aisha, may God be pleased with them, and on the words of God the Almighty: … “Wrap [a portion of] their headcovers (khimar) over their chests” (Quran 24: 31).• The khimar referred to in the above verse is a headcover and al-jayb refers to the front opening of shirt. In this verse, God commands Muslim women to cover their chests with their headcovers. If it were obligatory for a Muslim woman to cover her face, then the Quranic verse would have indicated this explicitly. A Prophetic tradition 'Aisha, may God be pleased with her, narrated that Asmaa` bint abu Bakr [her sister], entered upon the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) wearing transparent clothes. He turned away from her and said, \"O Asmaa`! If a woman reaches puberty nothing of her should be seen, except this and this,\" and he pointed to his face and hands” (Abu Dawud).Countering the opinion of the advocates of NiqabSome scholars maintain that a woman must cover her face due to 'Aisha's narration which states: \"Riders used to pass by us when we were with the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) wearing ihram. When they came near, each one of us would lower [part] of her garment from her head over her face. When they passed by, we would uncover our faces\" (Ahmed, abu Dawud, ibn Majah). • This hadith does not include evidence on the obligation of wearing niqab because the actions of the companions are not proof that something is an obligation. Moreover, the niqab may have been specific to the Mothers of Believers (the Prophet's wives) like the ruling that forbade them to marry after the Prophet's death. • It is determined in Ilm al-Usul (Principles of Jurisprudence) that anything that has multiple interpretations cannot be used as evidence. • The Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) said, \"A woman in ihram is not to cover her face nor wear gloves\" (Bukhari). Based on this statement there is a scholarly consensus that a woman must not cover her face nor wear gloves during prayer. It follows from this that a woman's face and hands are not 'awra (those parts of the body that must be covered). • It is not conceivable that the Shari'ah would legislate that a Muslim woman expose her 'awrah during prayer or while in ihram. The RulingIt is not obligatory for a Muslim woman to cover her face and hands. Niqab falls under 'permissible acts'; a woman is rewarded for wearing it but not punished for abstaining from it. A woman fulfills her religious duty concerning her attire by wearing the hijab.God Almighty knows best."

    "Question": " no. 1938 for the year 2004 which includes the following:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA woman married her work colleague and since then her in-laws consider her bad luck because of the myriad of troubles that befell them since the marriage. Please bear in mind that similar problems were troubling them even before the marriage, but the in-laws insist that their son's wife is the cause of bad luck- she has been both physically and psychologically harmed by such allegations which have damaged her reputation and dignity. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe would like to know the ruling concerning resorting to charlatans and sorcerers.</p>",
    "Answer": "Pessimism is among the things which Islam abolished and warned against. Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet [pbuh] said, \"There is no infectious disease nor [bad] omens and I prefer optimism.\" They [the companions) said, \"What is optimism?\" He replied, \"A good word\" [Muslim and Bukhari].Qabisa ibn al-Mukhariq narrated that he heard the Prophet [pbuh] say, \"Divination through the interpretation of the flight of birds, drawing lines on the ground and taking omens are all practices of jibt [worshipping other than Allah]\" [Related by abu Dawud with a good chain of transmission].Buraida [may Allah be pleased with him] narrated that the Prophet [pbuh] was never pessimistic. 'Urwa ibn 'Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"Omens were mentioned before the Prophet [pbuh] and he said, 'The best of it is a good omen; do not turn away a Muslim, and if one of you sees something which he does not like, he is to say, 'O Allah! Only You bring good and only You ward off evil. There is no might or power save through You' \" [Reported by abu Dawud with a good chain]. A Muslim who believes in bad omens may experience what he was pessimistic of and which created suspicions in his mind precisely because he attributed the incident to bad omens and not to the will of Allah, and this may ultimately be a punishment for his erroneous beliefs. This is because pessimism is a lack of trust in Allah Almighty. There are no bad omens in a womanWhat has been mentioned in some hadiths may give the impression that bad omens are attributed to horses, women and houses such as the hadith narrated by 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) who narrated that the Prophet [pbuh] said, \"There is no infectious disease or [bad] omens, but pessimism is in three: a horse, a woman and a house\" [Muslim and Bukhari]. What is meant in the context of these hadiths, is a person's personal incompatibility with these [three] things, which he usually cannot do without and which have a great impact upon his life either negatively or positively. This is further explained in another narration which states that the Prophet [pbuh] said, \"Three things are a source of happiness: a wife who pleases you when you see her and whom you can trust with her honor and your wealth in your absence, a fast riding animal which catches up with your companions and a spacious house with many rooms. Unhappiness is found in three things: a woman whose appearance displeases you when you see her and who talks back and whom you cannot trust to safeguard her chastity and your property in your absence, a slow riding animal which follows you when you strike it and which, if you leave alone, does not catch up with your companions and a small house which does not have many rooms.\" Charlatans, sorcerers and fortune tellersIslamic law prohibits resorting to charlatans and sorcerers and relying upon them for good luck or warding off evil. 'Umran ibn Hasin (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet [pbuh] said, \"He is not one of us who believes a [bad] omen or has someone predict it for him, divine the future or has someone do it for him, practices magic or has someone do it for him. Whoever visits a fortuneteller, and believes in what he says has denied what was revealed to Mohammed [pbuh].\" [Reported by al-Bazar with a good chain of transmission]Visiting soothsayers and believing them is a reason for not having one's prayers accepted. The Prophet [pbuh] said, \"The prayers of one who solicits a soothsayer and believes in what he tells him will not be accepted for forty nights\" [Reported by Muslim from the hadiths narrated from some of the Prophet's wives].The RulingThe above demonstrates that it is forbidden in Islamic law to be pessimistic of one's wife because all matters have causes which are decreed by the will of Allah Almighty. A wife has no hand in the good or evil that a man may experience.Allah Almighty knows best."
